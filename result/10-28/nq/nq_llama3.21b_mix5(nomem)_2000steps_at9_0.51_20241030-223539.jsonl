{"id": "40", "question": "name the process of fusion of an egg with a sperm", "response": "The process of fusion of an egg with a sperm is called fertilization. This process involves the union of a human egg and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. The fusion of the egg and sperm is mediated by a protein called CD9, which plays a role in the fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg. The fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg is likely mediated by bindin, a protein that binds to a receptor on the vitelline membrane identified as EBR1. The fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg is also likely mediated by a protein called phospholipase C zeta, which is released from the sperm after the fusion of the sperm and egg.

This process is known as oxidative phosphorylation. In the chloroplasts of plants, ATP is synthesized through a process called the light-dependent reaction, which occurs in the thylakoid membrane. This process is also known as the Hill reaction. It is the primary mechanism of ATP synthesis in plants and is responsible for the majority of ATP production in photosynthesis. The light-dependent reaction involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which is then used to drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH in the stroma of the chloroplast.

This is because the actin and myosin filaments are rigid and cannot relax, making the meat less tender. Rigor mortis, which occurs after death, causes the muscle fibers to become stiff and rigid, leading to a tougher texture. Therefore, it is essential to prevent rigor mortis in the animal to ensure that the meat remains tender and pliable during processing.\n\n2. **Preventing Cold Shortening**: Cold shortening is a phenomenon where the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length after death, leading to a loss of water-h", "gold_answer": ["tenderness of meat"], "Score": 1.0}

The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596. The concept was independently and more fully developed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, but his theory was rejected by some for lack of a mechanism (though this was supplied later by Arthur Holmes). The idea of continental drift has been subsumed by the theory of plate tectonics, which explains how the continents move. The process of continental drift is driven by the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outermost solid layer of the planet. The lithosphere is broken into large plates that float on the mantle, the layer beneath the Earth's crust. These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the mantle and sometimes colliding with each other.
