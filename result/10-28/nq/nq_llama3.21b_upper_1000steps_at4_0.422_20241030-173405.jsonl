{"id": "209", "question": "what type of plate boundary is associated with iceland and its volcanic eruptions", "response": "The type of plate boundary associated with Iceland and its volcanic eruptions is a divergent plate boundary, specifically a transform plate boundary. This type of plate boundary is characterized by the movement of two tectonic plates that are sliding past each other horizontally, without creating or destroying the plates. In the case of Iceland, the Eurasian and North American plates are moving apart, resulting in the formation of a rift zone where magma and volcanic activity are more likely to occur. The Reykjanes Ridge, which runs along the western edge of Iceland, is a prominent example of a divergent plate boundary, where the North American plate is moving away from the Eurasian plate. This type of plate boundary is often associated with volcanic activity, as the movement of the plates can create a zone of extensional stress, leading to the formation of rifts and fissures, which can produce volcanic eruptions.", "gold_answer": ["divergent tectonic plate boundary", "a divergent tectonic plate boundary", "the mid-Atlantic Ridge"], "Score": 0.0}

Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

The transition to a market economy meant that the central government no longer had control over the allocation of resources, leading to a mismatch between supply and demand.\n\n2. **Lack of market signals**: The absence of market signals in the transition economies meant that the government had no way of knowing how to allocate resources efficiently.
