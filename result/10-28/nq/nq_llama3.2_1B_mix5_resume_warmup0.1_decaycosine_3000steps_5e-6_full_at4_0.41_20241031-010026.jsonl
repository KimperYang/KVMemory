This can lead to a buildup of toxins in the blood, which can cause a range of symptoms, including jaundice, fatigue, and liver failure.\n\nTPN is a suitable treatment option for liver dysfunction because it bypasses the liver's role in nutrient absorption and metabolism. By providing the necessary nutrients, TPN can help to support the body's needs and promote healing. TPN can be administered intravenously, which allows for a more rapid and efficient delivery of nutrients compared to oral nutrition.
