This process involves the union of a human egg and a sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century. The fusion between the oocyte plasma membranes and sperm follows and allows the sperm nucleus, the typical centriole, and atypical centriole that is attached to the flagellum, but not the mitochondria, to enter the oocyte. The protein CD9 likely mediates this fusion in mice (the binding homolog). The egg \"activates\" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. Zinc atoms are released during this activation.

It has a dense, almost gel-like texture. Tomato puree, on the other hand, is a thinner, more liquid sauce made by cooking tomatoes for a shorter period, straining out the solids, and then blending the remaining liquid into a smooth, uniform consistency. It has a lighter, more liquid texture.\n\n2. **Flavor:** The flavor of tomato paste is more intense and concentrated than tomato puree, with a deeper, richer taste.
