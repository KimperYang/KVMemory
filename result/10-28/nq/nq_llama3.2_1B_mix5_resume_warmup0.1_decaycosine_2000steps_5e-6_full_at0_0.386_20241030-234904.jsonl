The lithosphere is broken into several large plates that float on the mantle, the layer beneath the Earth's crust. These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the mantle and sometimes colliding with each other, causing the plates to break apart and form new crust. This process is known as plate tectonics. The movement of the plates can be divided into three main types: divergent, convergent, and transform.

He then isolated the vagus nerve and observed that the heart rate of the frog was affected by the vagus nerve, even when the vagus nerve was cut. Loewi proposed that the vagus nerve was transmitting signals to the heart through chemical means, and he coined the term \"chemical synapse\" to describe this phenomenon.
