This results in a loss of moisture, which can lead to a decrease in the meat's tenderness and pliability. To prevent cold shortening, a process called electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses immediately after slaughter and skinning. This process depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass, preventing cold shortening and maintaining the meat's tenderness.\n\n2. **Improving Tenderization**: Rigor mortis can be used to improve the tenderness of meat.

Tomato puree, on the other hand, is a thinner, more liquid consistency, with a coarser texture than tomato paste. This is because tomato puree has not been strained or ground as much, leaving some of the tomato solids and seeds in the mixture.\n\n2. Flavor: The flavor of tomato paste is more intense and concentrated than tomato puree, as it has been cooked for a longer time to remove excess water and develop a deeper, richer taste.

This process is driven by the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outermost solid layer of the planet. The lithosphere is broken into large plates that float on the mantle, which is the layer of hot, viscous rock beneath the Earth's surface. These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the mantle and sometimes colliding with each other. This motion is known as plate tectonics. The movement of the plates is responsible for the creation of mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. The continents are also being pulled apart by the movement of the plates, which is known as continental rifting. This process is responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust and the creation of rift valleys.
