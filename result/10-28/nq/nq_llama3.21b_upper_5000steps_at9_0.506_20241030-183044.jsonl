This process involves the fusion of the plasma membranes of the egg and sperm, allowing the sperm nucleus, the typical centriole, and atypical centriole that is attached to the flagellum, but not the mitochondria, to enter the egg. The protein CD9 likely mediates this fusion in mice (the binding homolog). The egg \"activates\" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. Zinc atoms are released during this activation. This process ultimately leads to the formation of a diploid cell called a zygote.

The pier was damaged in a fire in 1952 and did not reopen until 1958. It was closed again in 2006, and plans were drawn up to convert the structure into a hotel and leisure complex.
