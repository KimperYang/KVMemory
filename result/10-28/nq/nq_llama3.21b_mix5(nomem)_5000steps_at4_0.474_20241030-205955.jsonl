Ecology had now gained general acceptance as a scientific discipline, and many concepts such as the \"triple bottom line\" (people, planet, and profit) and the \"integrated assessment model\" (IAM) were developed.

This process helps to concentrate the flavors and thicken the paste.\n   - Tomato puree, on the other hand, is made by cooking tomatoes and then straining the mixture to remove the solids, leaving just the tomato flesh and pulp. This leaves the tomato paste with a coarser texture and a more rustic flavor.\n\n2.

This process is driven by the convection currents in the mantle, which are caused by the heat generated by radioactive decay in the Earth's core. As the new crust moves away from the ridge, it is gradually destroyed, and the older crust is pushed back into the mantle.

This process is driven by the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outermost solid layer of the planet. The lithosphere is broken into large plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere below. These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the asthenosphere and sometimes colliding with each other. The movement of the plates is driven by convection currents in the asthenosphere, which are caused by heat from the Earth's interior. The movement of the plates causes the continents to move apart, creating new oceans and seas. The continents are also pulled apart by the movement of the tectonic plates, which can cause the Earth's crust to buckle and create rifts. The movement of the continents is also influenced by the movement of the Earth's mantle, which is the layer of hot, viscous rock beneath the lithosphere.
