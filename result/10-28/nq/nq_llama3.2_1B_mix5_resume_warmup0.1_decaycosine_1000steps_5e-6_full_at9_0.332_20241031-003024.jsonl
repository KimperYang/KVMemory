The Treasury Department decided to discontinue the production of all denominations of United States Notes, which included the two-dollar bill. The two-dollar bill was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Bank Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued.

Production of the two-dollar bill began to decrease. The relative scarcity of the bills led some to start saving any they found, with the inevitable result that the bills became rarer in circulation. Currently, the circulation of two-dollar bills accounts for around 1% of the U.S. currency in circulation.

Loewi, a professor of physiology at the University of California, Irvine, discovered that neurons can communicate not just via action potential and chemical synapse, but through non-synaptic interactions without such impulses. In 1921, Loewi published a paper in the journal \"Science\" that described his experiments on the vagus nerve of frogs, which showed that the vagus nerve could communicate with the ciliary ganglion, a nerve bundle in the eye, by releasing chemicals. This discovery led to the concept of bioelectricity and the idea that direct electrical contact between nerves and muscles mediated transmission of excitation.
