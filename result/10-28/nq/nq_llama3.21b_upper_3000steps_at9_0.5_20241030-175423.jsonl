This process is the union of a sperm and an egg, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. The fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg are likely mediated by bindin. The egg \"activates\" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. Zinc atoms are released during this activation. This process ultimately leads to the formation of a diploid cell called a zygote. The zygote divides to form a blastocyst and, where the spermatozoon is about to pierce, the yolk (ooplasm) is drawn out into a conical elevation, termed the cone of attraction or reception cone.

When meat is cooled after death, the actin and myosin filaments in the muscle fibers begin to cross-bond, causing the meat to become tough and less palatable. This process is accelerated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, which triggers powerful muscle contraction. By preventing rigor mortis, cold shortening is prevented, which in turn allows for better tenderness.\n\n2. Water holding capacity: Rigor mortis also affects the water-holding capacity of meat.

In 1854, Napp authorized Mendel to carry out a study in the monastery's 2 hectares (4.9 acres) experimental garden, which was originally planted by Napp in 1830. Unlike Nestler, who studied hereditary traits in sheep, Mendel used the common edible pea and started his experiments in 1856. Mendel's work on pea plants led to the discovery of the fundamental laws of inheritance, which are still used today to understand how genes are passed down from one generation to the next.
