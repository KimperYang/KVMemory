The nucleus is inherited from both parents and contains all the genetic information necessary for the development of an individual. Mitochondria, on the other hand, are inherited maternally and are responsible for producing energy for the cell. They are found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and are responsible for producing ATP, the energy currency of the cell. DNA is also found in the mitochondria, but it is not inherited from the mother. Instead, it is passed down from the father to all of his offspring.
