He believed that the amount of a poison required to produce a harmful effect was directly proportional to the amount of the poison that was ingested or inhaled. This idea was later refined and popularized by the English physician John Hunter, who wrote in his book \"The Natural History of Diseases\" in 1752: \"The dose of poison is the quantity which produces the effect; and the quantity of the poison which produces the effect is the dose.\" This idea was further developed by the German physician Justus von Liebig, who wrote in his book \"On the Chemical History of Agriculture\" in 184", "gold_answer": ["credited to Paracelsus", "Paracelsus"], "Score": 1.0}

This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of neuroscience and revolutionized our understanding of how the nervous system works. Loewi's work was a significant contribution to the development of modern neuroscience, and his discovery of neurotransmitters paved the way for the development of many important medical treatments, such as the use of drugs to treat various neurological disorders. Loewi's discovery of neurotransmitters also led to the development of the field of pharmacology, which is the study of the chemical properties of drugs and their effects on the body.
