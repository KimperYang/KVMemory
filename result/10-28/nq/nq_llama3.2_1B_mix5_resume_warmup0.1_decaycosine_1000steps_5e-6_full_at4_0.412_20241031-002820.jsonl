The partial melting of the mantle is a result of the decrease in pressure at the boundary, which is caused by the movement of tectonic plates. As the plates move apart, the crust is stretched and thinned, allowing the mantle to rise and produce magma. The magma then rises through the crust, cools, and solidifies, forming new oceanic crust.
