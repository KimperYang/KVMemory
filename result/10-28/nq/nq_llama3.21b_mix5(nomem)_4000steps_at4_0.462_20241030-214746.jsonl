Texture:\n   - Tomato paste has a thick, dense, and almost gel-like consistency, which is perfect for adding flavor to dishes like pasta sauces, soups, and stews.\n   - Tomato puree, by contrast, has a thinner consistency and a more liquidy texture, making it ideal for sauces,", "gold_answer": ["consistency"], "Score": 1.0}

The answer is photoelectric smoke detector. A photoelectric smoke detector uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell to detect smoke. The light source in a photoelectric smoke detector is typically an incandescent light bulb or light-emitting diode (LED), which is positioned at a 90-degree angle to the sensor. When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the sensor and triggers the alarm. The photoelectric smoke detector is more sensitive to the smoldering stage of a fire, as it can detect the small amounts of smoke produced by slow-smouldering fires. It is also more reliable in high air-flow environments, as it is less affected by the air flow. In contrast, ionization smoke detectors are weaker in high air-flow environments, and are more effective at detecting fast-flaming", "gold_answer": ["optical smoke detector"], "Score": 0.0}
