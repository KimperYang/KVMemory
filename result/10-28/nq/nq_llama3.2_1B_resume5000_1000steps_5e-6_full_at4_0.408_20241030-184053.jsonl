In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that demonstrated the existence of chemical synapses. He used the vagus nerve of frogs to study the transmission of signals between neurons. Loewi found that the vagus nerve could be stimulated by electrical stimulation, and that the response was not due to the electrical current itself, but rather to the release of a chemical substance from the neuron. This discovery was a significant breakthrough in neuroscience, as it provided a new mechanism for understanding how neurons communicate with each other. Loewi's work was a major milestone in the development of modern neuroscience, and it paved the way for further research into the neural code and the mechanisms of synaptic transmission.
