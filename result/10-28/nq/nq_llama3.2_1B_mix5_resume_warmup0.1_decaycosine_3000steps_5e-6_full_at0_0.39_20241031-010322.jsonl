This loss of wealth was exacerbated by the fact that the transition was accompanied by a significant decline in the availability of consumer goods, as many of the state-owned enterprises that had previously produced them were also privatized.\n\nThe transition also had a significant impact on the region's labor market.

In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that demonstrated that the vagus nerve could transmit signals through chemical means. He used a frog's heart and found that the vagus nerve could cause the heart to beat faster by releasing chemicals into the heart muscle.
