The human choroid is thickest at the far extreme rear of the eye (at 0.2 mm), while in the outlying areas it narrows to 0.1 mm. The choroid provides oxygen and nourishment to the outer layers of the retina. Along with the ciliary body and iris, the choroid forms the uveal tract. The structure of the choroid is generally divided into four layers (classified in order of furthest away from the vitreous humour). The posterior hyaloid membrane separates the rear of the vitreous from the retina. It is a false anatomical membrane. The anterior hyaloid membrane separates the front of the vitreous from the lens.

This makes it easier to cut and process the meat, as it is less likely to tear or break during the cutting process. Additionally, the rigidity of the meat also helps to prevent the formation of tough, chewy, or hard textures that can be undesirable in various meat products.\n\n2. **Meat Quality**: Rigor mortis affects the overall quality of the meat.

This process involves the movement of tectonic plates, where the crust is being pulled apart and new crust is being formed as the plates move away from each other. The new crust is made up of basaltic rocks that are formed through the partial melting of the mantle, which is driven by convection currents in the sub-lithospheric mantle. As the new crust moves away from the ridge, it is destroyed at subduction zones, where it is forced under continental crust or oceanic crust, and is recycled into the mantle.
