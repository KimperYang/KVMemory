Each section is divided into three parts: a key word, a note, and a summary. The key word is a brief summary of the main idea of the section, the note is a more detailed summary of the information, and the summary is a review of the key word and note. This hierarchical structure allows for easy review and recall of the information, as well as for the student to organize their thoughts and ideas in a logical and coherent manner.

The sensor is made up of a light-sensitive material, such as a photodiode, which is sensitive to light. When the light hits the sensor, it triggers an alarm if the light intensity is below a specified threshold, indicating the presence of smoke.

{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. Liver dysfunction can be caused by various factors such as viral infections, alcohol abuse, fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These conditions can lead to liver failure, which is a condition where the liver is unable to perform its normal functions. In such cases, the liver cannot produce the necessary nutrients and proteins for the body to function properly. TPN is the most appropriate method of nutrition for patients with liver dysfunction because it bypasses the liver and allows for the delivery of essential nutrients directly into the bloodstream. This method of nutrition is particularly useful for patients who have liver failure because it ensures that the nutrients are delivered to the body's tissues and organs, rather than being metabolized by the liver. Additionally, TPN can help to prevent complications such as malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances that can occur in patients with liver dysfunction.", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
