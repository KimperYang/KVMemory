{"id": "288", "question": "where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading", "response": "New crust comes from the oceanic lithosphere, which is being created at mid-ocean ridges. This process is called seafloor spreading. The new crust is formed when magma rises from the mantle and cools on the ocean floor. As the magma cools, it solidifies into new oceanic crust. This process is driven by the heat from the mantle, which causes the magma to rise and cool. The new crust is then pushed away from the ridge by the movement of the oceanic plates. The new crust is formed in a process called \"conveyer belt spreading\", where the new crust is pushed away from the ridge by the movement of the oceanic plates.
