It receives bile and pancreatic juice from the liver and pancreas, respectively, and helps to emulsify fats, making them easier to digest. The bile and pancreatic juice contain enzymes that break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be absorbed. The bile also contains bile salts, which help to emulsify fats and make them more accessible to enzymes. The bile salts are absorbed in the ileum, the final section of the small intestine.

Enamel is composed of about 95% fluorapatite, a form of fluorapatite that is more resistant to acid attack than the original hydroxyapatite. Fluorapatite is formed when fluoride ions are present in the enamel along with calcium and phosphate ions. The fluoride ions catalyze the diffusion of calcium and phosphate ions into the enamel, forming a fluorapatite-like structure that is more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite. This fluorapatite-like structure is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be, and it is formed in the enamel layer that is exposed to the oral environment.
