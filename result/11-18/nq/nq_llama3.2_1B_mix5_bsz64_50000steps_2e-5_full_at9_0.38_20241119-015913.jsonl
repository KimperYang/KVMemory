The classification below relates to the United States of America. Different classifications exist in other countries. The most common method to control a class-A fire is to remove heat by spraying the burning solid fuels with water. Another method of controlling a class-A fire would be to reduce the oxygen content of the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the fire. This is often water, which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam.

This discovery was a significant breakthrough in understanding the role of chemical synapses in the nervous system.\n\nIn the 1960s, the American neurophysiologist Ricardo Miledi and the British neurophysiologist John Newport Langley also contributed to the understanding of chemical synapses.
