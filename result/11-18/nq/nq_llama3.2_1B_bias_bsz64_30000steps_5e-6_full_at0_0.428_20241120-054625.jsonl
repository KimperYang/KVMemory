Evapotranspiration is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. The water molecule has smaller molecular mass than the major components of the atmosphere, nitrogen and oxygen, and, hence is less dense. Due to the significant difference in density, buoyancy drives humid air higher. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds.
