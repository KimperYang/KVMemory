{"id": "342", "question": "which type of fire detector uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell", "response": "The type of fire detector that uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell is an ionization smoke detector. Ionization smoke detectors are designed to detect the ionization of air caused by smoke particles. When smoke particles enter the chamber, they collide with the photo-electric cell, causing a current to flow. This current is then measured and compared to a set threshold value to determine if a fire is present. Ionization smoke detectors are more sensitive to the flaming stage of a fire and are less sensitive to the smoldering stage. They are also more reliable in high air-flow environments, as they are less affected by obstructions such as smoke or dust. Photoelectric smoke detectors, on the other hand, use the difference in the reflection of light between smoke and clear air to detect the presence of smoke particles. These detectors are less sensitive to the flaming stage of a fire and are more sensitive to the smoldering stage.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to several scientists, but the most notable one is Otto Loewi. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that revolutionized the understanding of neural communication. He demonstrated that the action of the vagus nerve on the heart rate was not due to direct contact with the nerve but rather through the release of a chemical substance, acetylcholine (ACh). This discovery, known as the \"Loewi current,\" confirmed the hypothesis that neurons communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical impulses.\n\nLoewi's work was initially met with skepticism, as it contradicted the prevailing theory of the time, which held that neurons communicate through electrical signals. However, his findings were later confirmed by other scientists, such as Charles Sherrington and Edgar Adrian, who also discovered the role of ACh in neural communication.\n\nIn summary, Otto Loewi is the scientist who first demonstrated that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals, specifically the", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 1.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through TPN is a patient with a catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancy. This is because the patient's gastrointestinal tract is no longer functioning, and they are unable to absorb nutrients from their food. TPN is a specialized form of nutrition that bypasses the digestive system and delivers nutrients directly into the bloodstream, providing the patient with the necessary nutrients to maintain their health and support their body's functions.\n\nIn this case, the patient would require TPN to ensure they receive the necessary nutrients to support their health and well-being. TPN can be delivered through various routes, including central venous access, peripheral venous access, or intramuscularly. The choice of route will depend on the patient's individual needs and preferences, as well as the availability of equipment and personnel to administer the therapy.\n\nIt is important to note that TPN is a highly specialized form of nutrition, and it is essential to work closely with a healthcare team to determine the most appropriate treatment plan", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Gestalt psychology is a significant branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, memory, and learning. It was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, who sought to explain how the brain organizes sensory information into meaningful patterns. Gestalt psychology has had a lasting impact on various fields, including psychology, education, and design. It has also influenced other areas of science, such as computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and art. Today, gestalt principles are still relevant in many aspects of our lives, from how we perceive and process information in the digital age to how we design and interact with technology.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
