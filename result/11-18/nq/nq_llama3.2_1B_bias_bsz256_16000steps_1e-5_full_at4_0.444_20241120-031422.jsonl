They are classified into three main types: alpha motor neurons, gamma motor neurons, and beta motor neurons. Alpha motor neurons are responsible for controlling extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the larger, more visible fibers that are responsible for the quick, powerful contractions of skeletal muscles. Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers, which are the smaller, more delicate fibers that are responsible for the slow, precise contractions of skeletal muscles. Beta motor neurons are responsible for controlling the number of motor units, which are groups of muscle fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals is attributed to several scientists, but the most notable one is Otto Loewi. In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that provided strong evidence for the existence of chemical transmission in the nervous system. He demonstrated that the vagus nerve of frogs could be stimulated by electrical stimulation of the cat's vagus nerve, and that this stimulation resulted in a change in heart rate. This discovery, known as the \"Loewi effect,\" showed that the nervous system could communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical signals.\n\nLoewi's work was a significant breakthrough in understanding the nervous system, as it provided evidence for the existence of chemical transmission in the brain. However, it was not until the 1930s that the chemical nature of this transmission was further elucidated. In 1931, Henry Hallett Dale, a British physiologist, discovered that the release of a chemical substance, acetylcholine", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through TPN is a patient with a catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancy. This is because the gastrointestinal tract is no longer functioning, and the patient is unable to absorb nutrients from the gut. TPN is a method of delivering nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system, and is often used in such cases to ensure that the patient receives adequate nutrition.\n\nIn addition, a patient with a catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancy may also require other interventions such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, which can all have a significant impact on the patient's nutritional status. TPN can help to ensure that the patient receives the necessary nutrients to support their recovery and treatment, even if they are unable to eat or digest food normally.\n\nIt is important to note that while TPN can be an effective treatment for patients with catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancies, it is not without risks. Patients who receive TPN are at a higher risk of developing complications such as infection, hyperglyc", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Gestalt psychology is a significant branch of psychology that focuses on the organization of perception and cognition. It was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, who sought to understand how the mind organizes and interprets sensory information. Gestalt psychology emphasizes the importance of the whole over the parts, and argues that the brain organizes sensory data into meaningful patterns and structures.\n\nToday, gestalt psychology ideas are part of cognitive psychology, which is a subfield of psychology that studies mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, language, and problem-solving. Cognitive psychologists often build on the work of earlier psychologists, such as Gestalt psychologists, to develop theories and models of cognitive processes. In addition, gestalt psychology has also influenced other fields, such as art, design, and education, as it emphasizes the importance of the whole and the organization of information.\n\nIn summary, gestalt psychology ideas are part", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
