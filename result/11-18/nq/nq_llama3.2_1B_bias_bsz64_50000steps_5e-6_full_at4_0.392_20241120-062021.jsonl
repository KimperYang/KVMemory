PNALD is a serious complication that can occur in patients who receive TPN, particularly those with a history of liver disease or those who have undergone liver transplantation. The liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body, which can cause a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, PNALD can lead to liver failure, which can result in the need for a liver transplant. Therefore, TPN is often used to provide nutrition to patients with PNALD, as it bypasses the digestive system and allows for the direct delivery of nutrients to the body.\n\nIt is important to note that while TPN can be an effective treatment for PNALD", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
