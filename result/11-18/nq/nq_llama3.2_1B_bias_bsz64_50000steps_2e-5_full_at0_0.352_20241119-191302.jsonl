This process is driven by the heat from the mantle, which causes the magma to rise and cool. The new crust is then pushed away from the ridge by the movement of the oceanic plates. The new crust is formed in a process called \"conveyer belt spreading\", where the new crust is pushed away from the ridge by the movement of the oceanic plates.

This led him to the conclusion that the nerve was not a continuous structure, but rather a collection of discrete cells that could communicate with each other. Sherrington's work was further developed by John Newport Langley, who also proposed that the nervous system was a collection of discrete cells that could communicate with each other.
