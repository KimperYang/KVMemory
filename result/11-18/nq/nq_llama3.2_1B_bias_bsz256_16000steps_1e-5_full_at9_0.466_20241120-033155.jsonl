Ionization smoke detectors are designed to detect the ionization of air caused by smoke particles. When smoke particles enter the detector's chamber, they collide with the ionization gas, which consists of sodium and argon gases. The collision causes the sodium atoms to ionize, creating a positive charge on the sodium atoms. The negative charge on the argon atoms then attracts the positive charge, creating an electric field. This electric field causes a current to flow in the detector's circuit, which is then detected by the photo-electric cell. The photo-electric cell is typically a photodiode that is sensitive to infrared light. When the current in the detector's circuit reaches a predetermined level, the alarm is triggered.

This term is used to describe the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The water cycle is a complex process that involves the movement of water in three phases: liquid, solid (ice) and gas (water vapor). The water cycle is driven by the sun and the energy it provides. The sun heats the Earth's surface, causing water to evaporate from oceans, lakes, rivers and even the ground. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere and forms clouds. When the clouds become saturated, the water vapor condenses into droplets, forming rain, snow, sleet or hail. The rain falls to the ground as runoff or infiltrates into the soil as groundwater. The water then moves through the water cycle again, either evaporating from the oceans or condensing and falling as rain.

These convection currents cause the mantle to move, and this movement in turn causes the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's lithosphere (the outermost layer of the planet) to move. The movement of the tectonic plates is what causes the continents to drift apart. The movement of the plates is driven by heat from the Earth's core, which causes the mantle to rise and cool, forming a buoyant layer of rock.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to several scientists, but the most notable one is Otto Loewi. In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated that the vagus nerve of the frog could cause a heart rhythm to slow down. This was a significant discovery, as it suggested that the vagus nerve could be a chemical transmitter. Loewi's work was a major breakthrough in understanding the nervous system and paved the way for further research into the role of chemicals in neural communication.\n\nAnother important figure in this area is Richard H. Neher, who, in 1964, demonstrated that voltage-gated sodium channels are involved in the generation of action potentials in nerve cells. Neher's work provided evidence for the idea that action potentials are initiated by changes in the electrical properties of the cell membrane, rather than by changes in the concentration of ions within the cell. This idea was further developed by I. Michael Ryseco and others, who", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through TPN is a person with a catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancy. This is because the gastrointestinal tract is often completely blocked or has a leak, preventing the normal process of eating and digestion. As a result, the person is unable to absorb any nutrients from the gut, and TPN becomes the only feasible option for providing nutrition.\n\nIn addition, the person may also have other complications that make TPN necessary, such as:\n\n* Severe liver dysfunction, which can lead to a buildup of toxins in the blood and cause a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n* Severe kidney dysfunction, which can also lead to a buildup of toxins in the blood and cause similar symptoms to liver dysfunction.\n* Severe electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to muscle weakness, heart arrhythmias, and other serious complications.\n\nOverall, TPN is a necessary treatment for patients with a catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancy who are unable to eat and absorb", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Gestalt psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, memory, and learning. It was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, who sought to explain how the brain organizes sensory information into meaningful patterns. Gestalt psychology has had a significant impact on various fields, including psychology, education, and design. It has also influenced other areas of science, such as computer graphics and artificial intelligence. However, it is important to note that gestalt psychology is not a formal branch of psychology in the sense that it is not a separate discipline with its own set of theories and methods. Instead, it is a theoretical framework that can be applied to various areas of psychology and other disciplines. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that gestalt psychology ideas are part of psychology, rather than a separate branch of psychology.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
