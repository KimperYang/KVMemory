The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, and it is the first part of the digestive tract where food is digested. The duodenum is the part of the small intestine that receives bile from the liver and pancreatic juice from the pancreas. Bile and pancreatic juice contain enzymes that help break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into smaller molecules. In the case of starch, the enzymes in the bile and pancreatic juice, such as amylase, break down the starch into simpler sugars like glucose and maltose. These simpler sugars can then be absorbed by the intestinal cells and used as energy.

This process is driven by the movement of tectonic plates, which are large, rigid slabs of the Earth's lithosphere. The movement of the plates is caused by convection currents in the mantle, which are driven by heat from the Earth's core. As the plates move, they create new crust as they move over the existing crust. The new crust is formed by the melting of the mantle beneath the plates, which causes the mantle to expand and create a void. The void is filled with magma, which rises up the void and cools, forming new crust. The new crust is then pushed up by the plates, creating a new oceanic crust.
