He is often referred to as the father of toxicology. Paracelsus' maxim, which is now commonly known as the \"dose makes the poison\" principle, states that \"All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.\" This means that the toxic effect of a substance is directly proportional to the amount of the substance that is ingested, inhaled, or otherwise introduced into the body. The dose determines the severity of the toxic effect, and the higher the dose, the greater the potential for harm. This principle has been widely used in toxicology and medicine to understand the relationship between the amount of a substance and its toxic effects.", "gold_answer": ["credited to Paracelsus", "Paracelsus"], "Score": 1.0}

The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so the atomic number of the product of the decay is 36 - 1 = 35. Therefore, the product of the decay of krypton-85 is nitrogen-14. The mass number of nitrogen-14 is 14, which is the same as the mass number of krypton-85. The half-life of nitrogen-14 is 14.28 days, which is the same as the half-life of krypton-85.

In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that demonstrated the role of chemical synapses in the autonomic nervous system. He used frogs and found that the vagus nerve, which controls heart rate, could be stimulated by electrical stimulation of the nerve. This experiment led to the concept of bioelectricity and the idea that direct electrical contact between nerves and muscles mediated transmission of excitation. However, it was not until the 1950s that the concept of chemical synapses was fully developed. In 1955, Stephen J. Smith, a neuroscientist, discovered that electrical synapses could couple groups of cells into functional units. This discovery led to the development of the \"quantal hypothesis,\" which posits that neurons can communicate not just via action potential and chemical synapse, but through non-synaptic interactions without such impulses.

PNALD is a serious complication that can occur in patients who receive TPN, particularly those with liver dysfunction. The liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fats, and it also helps to detoxify harmful substances. When the liver is damaged, it cannot perform these functions effectively, leading to a buildup of toxins in the body. This can result in a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. In severe cases, PNALD can lead to liver failure, which requires immediate medical attention.\n\nThe other conditions that may require nutrition delivered through TPN include:\n\n1.

The Gestalt theory of perception posits that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and that the mind organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes. This theory has been influential in fields such as psychology, education, and design, and continues to be relevant in contemporary research and applications.
