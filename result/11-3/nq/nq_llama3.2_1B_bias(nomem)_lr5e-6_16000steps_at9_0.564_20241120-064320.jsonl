This process occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where the lithosphere is being stretched and pulled apart. As the plates move away from the ridge, the mantle material is forced up through the crust, creating a volcanic cone called a seafloor spreading center. The magma then cools and solidifies, forming new oceanic crust. This process is driven by the heat generated by the movement of the plates and the buoyancy of the magma as it rises to the surface.\n\nThe new crust is made up of basaltic rocks, which are rich in the element magnesium and have a low melting point. As the magma rises, it cools and solidifies, forming new oceanic crust.
