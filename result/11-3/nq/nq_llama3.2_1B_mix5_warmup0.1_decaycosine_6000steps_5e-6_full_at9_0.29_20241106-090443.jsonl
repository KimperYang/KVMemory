R\u00f6ntgen was a German physicist who discovered X-rays, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through solid objects. He was born in 1874 in Hanau, Germany, and studied physics at the University of Bonn. R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of X-rays was a result of his experiments with cathode rays, which are streams of electrons emitted by a cathode ray tube. He was the first to observe that the cathode rays could be deflected by a magnetic field, and he also discovered that the magnetic field could be used to deflect the cathode rays in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of X-rays was a major breakthrough in the field of physics, and it paved the way for the development of radioactivity and other branches of physics.\n\nIn 1901, R\u00f6ntgen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics", "gold_answer": ["Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen"], "Score": 0.0}

When smoke particles enter the cell, they cause a change in the electrical resistance of the cell, which triggers the alarm. Some smoke detectors use a laser to detect smoke particles, which can be more sensitive than a traditional photoelectric cell. Smoke alarms are commonly used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings to alert occupants of a fire and provide early warning of potential danger.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical synapses is attributed to two scientists, Otto Loewi and John H. Loewi. Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist, first demonstrated the chemical synapse in 1921. He showed that the vagus nerve of frogs could transmit signals to the spinal cord, which in turn caused the muscles to contract. Loewi's experiment involved the use of frog vagus nerves and spinal cord, and he found that the vagus nerve could transmit signals to the spinal cord, causing the muscles to contract. This experiment led to the conclusion that the vagus nerve was transmitting signals to the spinal cord, and that the spinal cord was transmitting signals back to the vagus nerve. Loewi's discovery of chemical synapses was a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience and paved the way for further research into the mechanisms of neural communication.\n\nJohn H.
