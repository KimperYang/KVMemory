When an object is placed in front of a concave mirror, the light rays are reflected in such a way that they converge to a single point, forming a real image. This is because the concave mirror has a curved surface that causes the light rays to bend and converge, resulting in a real image.\n\nThe image formed by a concave mirror is always virtual, upright, and of the same size as the object. This is because the image is formed at a point behind the mirror, and the light rays do not actually pass through the image, but rather are reflected back to the viewer.\n\nIn contrast, a convex mirror always forms a virtual image that is smaller than the object, and appears to be behind the mirror.", "gold_answer": ["inverted"], "Score": 0.0}
