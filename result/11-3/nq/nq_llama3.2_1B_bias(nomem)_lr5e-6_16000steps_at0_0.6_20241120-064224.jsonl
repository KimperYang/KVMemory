The mantle is divided into two layers: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle is the layer above the lithosphere, which is the solid outer layer of the Earth. The lower mantle is the layer below the lithosphere, which is the solid inner layer of the Earth. The movement of the lithosphere is driven by convection currents in the underlying mantle. These currents are caused by heat from the Earth's core, which causes the mantle to heat up and rise. As the mantle rises, it cools and contracts, causing it to sink back down. This process creates a cycle of upwelling and sinking of the mantle, which drives the convection currents in the mantle.
