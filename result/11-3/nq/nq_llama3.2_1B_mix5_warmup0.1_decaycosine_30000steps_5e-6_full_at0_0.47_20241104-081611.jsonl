This detector is the most common type of smoke detector and is used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. It works by detecting the light emitted by the smoke particles and triggering an alarm when the smoke reaches a certain level. The photo-electric cell is a light-sensitive device that converts the light into an electrical current. When smoke particles enter the cell, they scatter the light, which is then detected by the cell and triggers the alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors, and are less likely to trigger false alarms.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that revolutionized the understanding of the nervous system. He used frogs and discovered that the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve could cause a change in the heart rate of the frog. This was the first demonstration of the existence of a chemical messenger, now known as the neurotransmitter, that transmits signals between neurons.\n\nLoewi's discovery was a significant breakthrough in neuroscience, as it provided evidence for the existence of a chemical system that mediates the transmission of information between neurons. This discovery challenged the prevailing view at the time, which was that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve could cause a change in the heart rate of the frog. Loewi's work demonstrated that the vagus nerve was not just a passive conductor of electricity but an active transmitter of chemical signals.\n\nLoewi's discovery was a major milestone in the", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of glucose, amino acids, and other essential nutrients. When the liver is not functioning properly, it may not be able to produce these nutrients, leading to a state of malnutrition. TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction, as it provides all the necessary nutrients that the liver cannot produce on its own. This is particularly important for patients with severe liver disease, such as those with cirrhosis or liver failure, who may have difficulty absorbing nutrients from food.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include:\n\n1. Severe hepatic encephalopathy: This is a condition that occurs in patients with cirrhosis or liver failure, characterized by cognitive impairment, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.
