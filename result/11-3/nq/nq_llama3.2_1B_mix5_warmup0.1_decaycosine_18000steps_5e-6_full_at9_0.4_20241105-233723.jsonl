This detector is designed to detect smoke particles by measuring the amount of light that is scattered by the smoke particles. The photo-electric cell is a light-sensitive device that converts the scattered light into an electrical current. The amount of current generated depends on the intensity of the light scattered by the smoke particles. When smoke particles are present, they scatter the light, reducing the amount of light that reaches the photo-electric cell. This results in a decrease in the current generated by the cell, which is then sent to an alarm or other control device.\n\nPhotoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors. This is because the photo-electric cell is more sensitive to the small amounts of smoke particles that are present in the smoke. Additionally, photoelectric smoke detectors are less sensitive to the presence of other particles,", "gold_answer": ["optical smoke detector"], "Score": 0.0}

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist and Nobel laureate. In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that led him to the conclusion that electrical stimulation of the frog sciatic nerve resulted in twitching of the leg muscles, and from this he developed the concept of bioelectricity. This led to the idea that direct electrical contact between nerves and muscles mediated transmission of excitation. However, work by John Newport Langley had suggested that in the autonomic nervous system communication in the ciliary ganglion was chemical. Loewi's experiments, published in 1921, finally settled the issue, proving that synaptic transmission is chemical.\n\nIn 1955, Stephen J Smith, a neurophysiologist, published an article in the journal \"Science\", which proposed that certain glial cells in the human brain known as astrocytes would be able to communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical.

{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of essential nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot produce these nutrients, leading to a lack of energy and nutrients in the body. This can result in a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite. In severe cases, liver dysfunction can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body, which can cause serious health complications. TPN is often used to treat liver dysfunction by providing the necessary nutrients to support the liver's function and help the body recover. Other conditions that may require TPN include severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, and certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer. In these cases, the body is unable to absorb the necessary nutrients, and TPN", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, and cognition. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Kurt Goldstein, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand the \"organization\" of cognitive processes and the role of perception in shaping our understanding of the world. The Gestalt theory of perception posits that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and that our perception of the world is influenced by the way we organize and interpret sensory information. This theory has been influential in shaping modern theories of perception, attention, and cognition, and continues to be a central theme in contemporary research in psychology.\n\nIn addition to its influence on modern psychology, gestalt psychology has also had a significant impact on other fields, including philosophy, art, and design.
