Rain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called acid rain. Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

{"id": "288", "question": "where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading", "response": "In sea floor spreading, new crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. The process of seafloor spreading is driven by the movement of tectonic plates, where oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. The new crust is then pushed away from the ridge by the movement of the plates, creating a continuous process of crustal creation and destruction. The age of the oceanic crust is determined by the rate of seafloor spreading, with older crust being formed at faster rates.
