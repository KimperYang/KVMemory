For example, in the United States, the National Electric Code (NEC) recommends that transformers be rated for the maximum voltage of the system they are serving. This ensures that the transformers can safely handle the high voltage and prevent damage to the transformers or the power system. Low-voltage transformers are used to step down the high-voltage power to a level that is safe for consumers, such as 120 or 240 volts.

Gilbert's model was based on the observation that DNA strands have a repeating sequence of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The double helix model was initially met with skepticism, but it was later confirmed by X-ray crystallography, which revealed the double helix structure of DNA.

This experiment led to the concept of chemical synapses, which suggests that neurons can communicate through chemical messengers traversing the synaptic cleft, and in 1921, Loewi confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals.
