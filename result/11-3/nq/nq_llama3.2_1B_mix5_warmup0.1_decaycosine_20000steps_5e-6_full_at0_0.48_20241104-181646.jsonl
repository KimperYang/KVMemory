This detector is designed to detect smoke by converting the light emitted by the smoke into an electrical signal. The smoke particles scatter the light, which is then detected by the photo-electric cell. The photo-electric cell is a light-sensitive device that generates an electric current when it detects light. The electric current is proportional to the amount of light that is scattered by the smoke particles. This means that the photoelectric smoke detector can detect smoke even when the smoke is not visible to the naked eye. The photoelectric smoke detector is more sensitive to smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors, which use the ionization of air to detect smoke. The photoelectric smoke detector is also more reliable in high air-flow environments, as it is less affected by the presence of particles in the air.", "gold_answer": ["optical smoke detector"], "Score": 0.0}

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist and Nobel laureate. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that demonstrated the role of chemical messengers in the nervous system. He used frogs and found that the vagus nerve, which controls heart rate, could be stimulated by electrical stimulation of the nerve. This experiment led to the discovery of the \"vagus nerve reflex,\" which is a fundamental concept in neuroscience.\n\nLoewi's work was a significant milestone in understanding the nervous system, and it laid the foundation for the development of modern neuroscience. His discovery of chemical communication between neurons has had a profound impact on our understanding of the brain and its functions. It has also led to the development of various techniques for studying the nervous system, such as electrophysiology and neuroimaging.\n\nIn summary, Otto Loewi is the scientist who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals, specifically by demonstrating the", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot properly metabolize these nutrients, leading to a buildup of toxic substances in the body. This can result in a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. In severe cases, it can lead to liver failure, which requires immediate medical attention.\n\nTPN is a form of intravenous nutrition that delivers nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. It is often used to treat patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome. These patients have difficulty absorbing nutrients from food, and TPN is used to ensure that they receive the necessary nutrients to maintain their health and well-being.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, and cognition. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand how the human mind organizes and interprets sensory information. They proposed that perception is not a simple process of identifying and processing individual elements, but rather a more complex process of organizing and integrating information into a coherent whole. This idea is known as the Gestalt principle of unity in perception, which states that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Gestalt psychology has had a significant impact on various fields, including psychology, education, art, and design. It has also influenced other areas of research, such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.
