{"id": "311", "question": "how oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs", "response": "Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The pulmonary veins are small, thin-walled veins that carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. They are located on the left side of the heart, near the aorta, and are responsible for returning oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. The oxygenated blood then passes through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to the body through the aorta. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries throughout the body, delivering oxygenated blood to the different organs and tissues. The pulmonary veins are also responsible for returning deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart, which is then pumped out to the lungs to be oxygenated again. This process is known as the pulmonary circulation and is essential for the proper functioning of the heart and the body.", "gold_answer": ["pulmonary circulation"], "Score": 1.0}
