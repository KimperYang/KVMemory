This detector is designed to detect smoke by converting the light intensity into an electrical signal. The smoke particles scatter the light, which is then detected by the photo-electric cell. The photo-electric cell converts the scattered light into an electrical current, which is then processed and sent to an alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors, which use the ionization of smoke to trigger an alarm. They are also more reliable in high air-flow environments, as they are less affected by the presence of particles in the air. Photoelectric smoke detectors are commonly used in residential and commercial settings, and are often installed in smoke detectors that are connected to fire alarm systems.

The movement of these plates is driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle, which is the layer of hot, viscous rock beneath the lithosphere. As the mantle convects, it pushes and pulls the lithosphere, causing the plates to move. The movement of the plates can be slow, taking millions of years, or fast, taking only a few thousand years. Over time, the movement of the plates can cause the continents to drift apart, creating new oceans and landmasses.\n\nThe process of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of two scientists, Otto Loewi and Richard Tolman. However, the most significant contribution to this field was made by the American neurophysiologist and pharmacologist, Charles Sherrington, who first proposed the idea of chemical synapses in 1897. Sherrington's work was based on his experiments with frogs, where he demonstrated that the vagus nerve of a frog could control the heart rate by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve. This experiment led to the conclusion that sympathetic regulation of cardiac function could be mediated through changes in chemical concentrations.\n\nSherrington's work was further developed by the English neurophysiologist and pharmacologist, Charles Scott Zinn, who in 1921 demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve could result in twitching of the leg muscles. This experiment provided evidence for the existence of electrical synapses, which were later found to be the primary mechanism of", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 1.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot properly metabolize these nutrients, leading to a buildup of toxic substances in the body. This can result in a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. In severe cases, liver dysfunction can lead to liver failure, which requires a high level of nutrition to support the body's needs.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include:\n\n1. Severe hepatic dysfunction: This is a rare complication of liver disease, but it can lead to a buildup of toxic substances in the body, which can result in liver failure. TPN is often used to support the body's needs in these cases.\n2.

Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Goldstein, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand the \"organization\" of cognitive processes and the way in which the mind forms a global whole from the parts. This approach to perception and cognition has had a lasting impact on the field of psychology and continues to influence contemporary research in areas such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
