In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals, rather than electrical signals. This discovery was a significant milestone in the field of neuroscience, as it provided a mechanism for understanding how the nervous system transmits information and how it can be modulated by external stimuli. Loewi's work was a culmination of his lifelong interest in the nervous system and his ability to apply rigorous scientific methods to his research. His discovery of chemical synapses, as he called them, has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the brain and nervous system.", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}

TPN can provide the necessary nutrients to help the patient recover and regain their strength, allowing them to eat and absorb nutrients from food again. This is particularly important for patients who have undergone surgery to correct a gastrointestinal obstruction, as they may have a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}

Gestalt psychologists argue that our brains are designed to perceive and process information in a holistic manner, meaning that we tend to perceive patterns and relationships in the world around us, rather than just individual elements. This approach has been influential in various fields, including psychology, education, and design. In psychology, gestalt psychology is often contrasted with structuralism, which focuses on the analysis of individual elements to understand a whole. Gestalt therapy, a form of psychotherapy that draws on gestalt principles, is also based on this approach. It emphasizes the importance of the whole person and their unique experiences, and encourages clients to explore their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a holistic manner.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
