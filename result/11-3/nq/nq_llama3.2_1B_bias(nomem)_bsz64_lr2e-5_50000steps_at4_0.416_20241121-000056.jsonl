Here are some key points on the importance of rigor mortis in meat processing:\n\n1. Tenderness: Rigor mortis sets in within a few hours after death, which determines the tenderness of the meat. The onset of rigor mortis causes the muscles to become stiff and unable to relax, leading to a loss of elasticity and tenderness. This is in contrast to fresh meat, which is soft and pliable due to the presence of myoglobin, a pigment that helps to preserve the muscle and bind oxygen to the myoglobin.\n\n2. Quality: The degree of rigor mortis can affect the quality of the meat. In general, the more rigor mortis that occurs, the tougher the meat will be. This is because the longer the muscles remain rigid, the more collagen is exposed, which contributes to the meat's tenderness and flavor", "gold_answer": ["tenderness of meat"], "Score": 1.0}

The safety hazard was a significant issue, as it was one of the main reasons that the industry had initially adopted the pull tab in the first place. The industry had been trying to find a solution to this problem since the 1950s, and in 1962, Ermal Cleon \"Ernie\" Fraze, an engineer at American Can Company, developed the \"Stay-Tab\" which eliminated the need for a separate opener tool by attaching an aluminium pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. This design solved the safety hazard and made the pull tab obsolete.

The photo-electric cell is sensitive to light in the visible and infrared spectrum, and is typically made up of a photoelectric material, such as selenium, which is excited by the light and generates an electric current. When smoke particles enter the detector, they scatter the light, which is then reflected back to the photo-electric cell. The amount of light reflected depends on the size and shape of the smoke particles, as well as the distance between the light source and the detector. The photo-electric cell is designed to detect a specific range of light intensities, and will generate an alarm only when the amount of light reaching it exceeds a certain threshold.
