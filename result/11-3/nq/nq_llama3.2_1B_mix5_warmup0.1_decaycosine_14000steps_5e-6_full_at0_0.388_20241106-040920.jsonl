{"id": "288", "question": "where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading", "response": "In sea floor spreading, new crust is formed by the movement of oceanic crust along the mid-ocean ridges. This process is driven by the movement of tectonic plates and the convection currents in the sub-lithospheric mantle. As the oceanic crust is being pushed away from the ridge, it is forced to the surface by the upwelling of material beneath the ocean ridges. This process, known as seafloor spreading, creates new oceanic crust as the crust is being stretched and thinned. The new crust is made up of recycled oceanic crust that has been pushed away from the ridge, and it is also being created by the movement of tectonic plates. The movement of plates and the convection currents in the sub-lithospheric mantle cause the oceanic crust to be stretched and thinned, which results in the formation of new crust.

These laws describe how genetic information is passed down from one generation to the next and how it is distributed among the genes in an organism's DNA.\n\nMendel's work on pea plants was conducted between 1856 and 1863, during which he studied the inheritance of traits such as flower color, seed shape, and plant height. He discovered that the traits were inherited in a predictable and orderly manner, with each trait being determined by a single gene. Mendel's work also showed that the traits were inherited in a specific pattern, with one gene controlling the dominant trait and the other controlling the recessive trait.
