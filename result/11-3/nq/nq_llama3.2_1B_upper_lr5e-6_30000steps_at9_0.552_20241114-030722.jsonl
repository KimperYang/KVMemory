It is made by cooking tomatoes for several hours to reduce the water content, straining the mixture to remove excess liquid, and then concentrating the remaining solids. This process concentrates the flavors and aromas of the tomatoes, giving it a rich, intense taste. Tomato paste is often used as an ingredient in various dishes, such as sauces, stews, and marinades, where it adds depth and complexity to the flavor profile. It can also be used as a seasoning or a thickening agent in soups, stews, and sauces.\n\nTomato puree, on the other hand, is a liquid form of tomatoes that has been strained to remove the solids, leaving behind a smooth, clear liquid.
