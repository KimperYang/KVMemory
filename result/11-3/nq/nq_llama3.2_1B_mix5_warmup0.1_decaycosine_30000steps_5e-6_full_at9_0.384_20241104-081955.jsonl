This detector works by detecting the light emitted by the smoke particles and converting it into an electrical signal. The smoke particles scatter the light, which is then detected by the photo-electric cell. The cell converts the scattered light into an electrical current, which is then amplified and processed to generate an alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors, and are typically used in residential and commercial settings where fire protection is required without introducing unsightly or overtly modern devices. They are also more reliable in high air-flow environments, where fire protection is required without introducing unsightly or overtly modern devices.

In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments on frogs' vagus nerves, which led him to the conclusion that the vagus nerve was not a simple electrical conductor but rather a chemical transmitter. He demonstrated that the vagus nerve could be stimulated by electrical stimulation of the heart, and that the response was accompanied by a release of a chemical substance, which he named \"neurotransmitter.\" This discovery revolutionized the understanding of neural communication and paved the way for the development of modern neuroscience.\n\nLoewi's work was a significant milestone in the history of neuroscience, as it provided evidence for the existence of chemical messengers in the nervous system. This discovery challenged the prevailing view at the time, which held that all neural communication was electrical in nature. Loewi's work demonstrated that there were chemical signals, or neurotransmitters, that could be released by neurons", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of proteins, vitamins, and hormones. When the liver is not functioning properly, it may not be able to perform these essential functions, leading to a range of complications. Some of the symptoms of liver dysfunction include jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, and fatigue. In severe cases, liver dysfunction can lead to liver failure, which requires immediate medical attention.\n\nTPN is a form of intravenous nutrition that delivers nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. It is often used to treat patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome, as well as those with liver dysfunction. TPN can provide the necessary nutrients for the body to function properly, even when the digestive system is not working correctly. However, it", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, memory, and cognition. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, who sought to understand how the human mind organizes and interprets sensory information. They proposed that perception is not a matter of individual perception, but rather a collective process that involves the whole of the organism. This idea is known as the Gestalt principle of unity, which states that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Gestalt psychology has had a significant impact on various fields, including psychology, education, and design. It has also influenced other areas of study, such as cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy. In particular, gestalt psychology has been influential in the development of Gestalt therapy, Gestalt education, and Gestalt art therapy.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
