This is done to reduce the current flowing through the high-voltage transformer, which can help prevent overheating and improve efficiency. The low-voltage transformer is typically a step-down transformer, which means it has a lower voltage rating than the high-voltage transformer. The low-voltage transformer is connected in parallel with the high-voltage transformer, and the output voltage of the high-voltage transformer is stepped down to the level of the low-voltage transformer. This allows the high-voltage transformer to operate at a lower voltage, which can help reduce the current flowing through it and improve efficiency.
