When an object is placed in front of a concave mirror, the light rays converge to form a virtual image behind the mirror. This virtual image is always smaller than the object and appears to be behind the mirror.\n\nHowever, if the object is placed at a distance greater than the focal length of the concave mirror, the virtual image will appear to be real. This is because the light rays converge to a single point, forming a real image that is identical in size and shape to the original object.\n\nIn other words, a concave mirror can form a real image that is a copy of an object that forms a virtual image, but only when the object is placed at a distance greater than the focal length of the mirror.", "gold_answer": ["inverted"], "Score": 0.0}
