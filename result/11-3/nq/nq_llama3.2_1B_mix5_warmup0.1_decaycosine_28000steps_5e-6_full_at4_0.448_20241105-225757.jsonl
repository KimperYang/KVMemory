{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of two scientists, Otto Loewi and Richard Tolman. However, the most significant contribution to this field was made by the German neurophysiologist Otto Loewi (1873-1961). In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the existence of chemical messengers, now known as neurotransmitters, in the nervous system. He discovered that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve of frogs could cause a rapid increase in heart rate, which he attributed to the release of a chemical substance. This experiment led to the development of the neuron doctrine, which posited that neurons communicate through chemical messengers.\n\nLoewi's work was a significant milestone in the understanding of the nervous system, as it provided evidence for the existence of chemical communication between neurons. However, it was not until the 1950s that the concept of chemical transmission in the brain was further explored by other scientists, such as", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of glucose, amino acids, and other essential nutrients. When the liver is not functioning properly, it may not be able to produce these nutrients, leading to a state of malnutrition. TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction, as it provides the necessary nutrients to support the body's metabolic needs.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include severe hepatic dysfunction, which is a rare complication of liver disease. Severe hepatic dysfunction is a condition where the liver is unable to perform its normal functions, and it can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body.
