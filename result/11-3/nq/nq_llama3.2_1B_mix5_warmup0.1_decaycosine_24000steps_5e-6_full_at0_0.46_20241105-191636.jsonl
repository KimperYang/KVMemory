The lithosphere is broken into large plates that move relative to each other, creating and erasing continents and oceans. The movement of these plates is driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle, which is the layer of hot, viscous rock beneath the lithosphere. As the mantle convects, it creates heat that is transferred to the lithosphere, causing it to move. The movement of the plates can be either horizontal (sliding past each other) or vertical (up or down). The continents that are in the path of the moving plates are pulled apart, while the ones that are not are pushed together.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that led to the discovery of the chemical messenger, acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. Loewi's experiment involved the vagus nerve of frogs, which is a major nerve that connects the brain to the rest of the body. By stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi observed that the heart rate of the frog increased, indicating that the nerve impulse was being transmitted to the heart. This experiment demonstrated that the chemical messenger ACh was responsible for transmitting nerve impulses between neurons.\n\nLoewi's discovery of ACh was a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience, as it provided evidence for the existence of chemical messengers in the nervous system. This discovery also led to the development of the concept of chemical synapses,", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism and distribution of nutrients, and its dysfunction can lead to severe complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic failure, and even death. TPN is often used to support patients with liver dysfunction who have a high risk of developing these complications. The TPN solution is designed to provide all the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to the patient, bypassing the usual process of eating and digestion. This can help to improve the patient's overall health and quality of life, and can even help to prevent the development of these complications.\n\nIt is important to note that TPN is not a cure for liver dysfunction, and it is not recommended as the sole treatment for this condition. Instead, it is used as a supportive therapy to help manage the symptoms and prevent further complications. Other treatments, such as liver transplantation, may", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, and memory. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand how the mind organizes and interprets sensory information. They proposed that perception is not a simple process of identifying individual elements, but rather a more complex process of organizing and integrating information into a unified whole. This idea is known as gestalt theory, and it has had a significant impact on the development of psychology and other fields, such as art, design, and cognitive science.\n\nIn addition to its influence on psychology, gestalt theory has also had an impact on other fields, such as art and design. Gestalt principles, such as proximity, similarity, and closure, are used to create visually appealing and effective designs. For example, the use of color", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "499", "question": "how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island", "response": "Long John Silver lost his leg in \"Treasure Island\" due to a battle with the pirate Captain Flint. The two pirates had a disagreement over the location of the treasure, and Flint, who was known for his cunning and ruthlessness, decided to take matters into his own hands. He ordered his men to attack Long John Silver and his crew, and in the ensuing fight, Silver was severely injured. Flint then cut off Silver's leg, leaving him crippled and unable to walk. This event serves as a turning point in the novel, as it marks the beginning of Silver's descent into villainy and his eventual betrayal of his former crewmates.\n\nIt's worth noting that the film \"Long John Silver\" (1954) is a different adaptation of the novel, and it does not feature the character of Captain Flint or the loss of Silver's leg.
