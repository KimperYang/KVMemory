The answer to the question is \"the rose itself\", as the rose is the object of the statement. The phrase \"which we call a rose\" is a metaphorical expression that refers to the flower, and the statement \"who says that which we call a rose\" is a play on words that suggests that the person making the statement is the rose.

When two plates collide, they can push up against each other and form mountains, or they can slide past each other and create new crust.
