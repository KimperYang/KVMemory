Texture: Tomato paste is a thick, concentrated paste made by cooking tomatoes for several hours to reduce the water content, straining, and then grinding the mixture into a fine paste. This results in a paste with a dense, thick consistency, similar to a concentrated tomato sauce. On the other hand, tomato puree is a liquid with a thinner consistency, similar to a tomato sauce but without the thickening agent.\n\n2. Flavor: Tomato paste has a more intense, concentrated flavor due to the longer cooking process, which breaks down the cell walls of the tomatoes, releasing more of the natural sugars and acids. This results in a richer, more robust taste. Tomato puree, on the other hand, has a milder flavor, as it is less processed and has less of the concentrated tomato taste", "gold_answer": ["consistency"], "Score": 1.0}
