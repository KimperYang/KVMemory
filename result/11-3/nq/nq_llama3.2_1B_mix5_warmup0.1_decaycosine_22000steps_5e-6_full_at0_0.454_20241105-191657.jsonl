This detector is designed to detect smoke by converting the light emitted by the smoke into an electrical signal. The smoke detector has a light source, such as a light-emitting diode (LED), which is positioned at a 90-degree angle to the photo-electric cell. When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the photo-electric cell and triggers the alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to the flaming stage of fires than ionization smoke detectors, while ionization smoke detectors are more sensitive to fires in the early smouldering stage. The photoelectric smoke detector is also more reliable in high air-flow environments, as it is less affected by the presence of particles in the air.", "gold_answer": ["optical smoke detector"], "Score": 0.0}
