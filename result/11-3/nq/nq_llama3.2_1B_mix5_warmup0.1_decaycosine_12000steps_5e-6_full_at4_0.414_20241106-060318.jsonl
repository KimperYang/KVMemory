The villi increase the surface area for absorption, allowing for a greater capacity to absorb nutrients.

Fluoride ions are absorbed into the blood, where they distribute throughout the body. In infants, about 80-90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest excreted, mostly via urine; in adults, about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis. Fluoride is stored in the enamel of the teeth, where it is most concentrated. The enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, and it is the most resistant to acid attack. Fluoride ions are incorporated into the enamel, where they form a fluorapatite-like compound that is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be.
