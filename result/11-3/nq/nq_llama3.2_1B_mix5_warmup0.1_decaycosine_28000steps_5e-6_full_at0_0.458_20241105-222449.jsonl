Pauk developed this method in the 1940s as a way to help students organize their thoughts and improve their note-taking skills. The method is based on the idea of breaking down a lecture or class into smaller, manageable sections, and then using a specific note-taking system to organize and review the information. The Cornell Method is characterized by the use of a note-taking column, where students record key ideas and questions, and a key word column, where they write down the main points of the lecture. This method has been widely used in classrooms and study halls for over 70 years, and is still a popular choice for note-taking among students today. The method is particularly useful for students who need to review and recall information quickly, as it allows them to quickly scan and review the material without having to write down every detail.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that revolutionized the understanding of the nervous system. He used frogs and discovered that the electrical activity of the vagus nerve could be triggered by the presence of a chemical substance, which he named \"neurotransmitter.\" This discovery led to the development of the concept of chemical synapses, which suggests that neurons communicate through chemical messengers traversing the synaptic cleft, and in 1921, Loewi confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals. This work laid the foundation for our current understanding of neurotransmitter release as exocytosis and for which Otto Loewi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970.", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of glucose, amino acids, and other essential nutrients. When the liver is not functioning properly, it may not be able to produce these nutrients, leading to a deficiency in the body's nutritional needs. TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction, as it provides the necessary nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system and reducing the risk of complications such as bowel obstruction or infection.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include severe hepatic dysfunction, cirrhosis of the liver, and liver failure. These conditions can lead to a significant decrease in the liver's ability to produce nutrients, making TPN a necessary treatment option.\n\nIt is important to note that TPN is not a one-size-fits-all solution and should be individualized based on", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}
