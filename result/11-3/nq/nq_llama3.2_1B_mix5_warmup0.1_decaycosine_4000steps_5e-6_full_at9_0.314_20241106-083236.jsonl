However, the development of the pencil sharpener and the invention of the pencil sharpener's lead pencil in 1869 by American inventor Benjamin Franklin further increased the popularity of graphite pencils.

He published his findings in 1907 in a paper titled \"The Inhibitory Effect of the Sympathetic Nervous System on the Heart.\" In this paper, Sherrington demonstrated that the sympathetic nervous system can inhibit the heart rate, which is a physiological response to stress. He proposed that this inhibition is mediated by the release of a chemical substance called acetylcholine (ACh) from the sympathetic ganglia into the sympathetic nervous system.
