The smoke particles scatter the light, which is then detected by the photo-electric cell. The cell generates an electrical current when the light is scattered, and this current is proportional to the amount of smoke present. Photoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors, and are typically used in residential and commercial settings where fire safety is a concern.

In East Asia, where it was invented, the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and, without the hand mould, the printing press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to typography and fonts. The high quality and relatively low price of the Gutenberg Bible (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of two scientists, Otto Loewi and Richard Tolman. However, the most significant contribution to this field was made by the German neurophysiologist Otto Loewi (1873-1961). In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the existence of chemical messengers, now known as neurotransmitters, in the nervous system. He discovered that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve of frogs could cause a rapid increase in heart rate, which he attributed to the release of a chemical substance. This experiment led to the development of the \"Loewi's law,\" which states that the presence of a chemical substance (neurotransmitter) at a synapse (the junction between two neurons) is required for the transmission of an electrical signal.\n\nRichard Tolman (1886-1959), an American physiologist, also made significant contributions to the understanding of chemical communication in the nervous system", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of glucose, amino acids, and other essential nutrients. When the liver is not functioning properly, it may not be able to produce these nutrients, leading to a state of malnutrition. TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction, as it provides all the necessary nutrients that the liver cannot produce on its own. This is particularly important for patients with severe liver disease, such as those with cirrhosis or liver failure, who may have difficulty absorbing nutrients from food.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include:\n\n1.
