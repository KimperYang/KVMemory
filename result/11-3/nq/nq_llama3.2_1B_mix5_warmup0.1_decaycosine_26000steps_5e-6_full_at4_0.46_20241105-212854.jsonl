This detector type is also known as a photoelectric smoke alarm or a smoke alarm. It contains a light source, typically a photodiode, which is positioned at a 90-degree angle to the smoke particles. When smoke particles enter the chamber, they scatter the light, which is then detected by the photodiode. The photodiode generates an electric current, which is proportional to the amount of smoke particles in the chamber. The alarm is triggered when the current exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating the presence of smoke.\n\nPhotoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to the flaming stage of fires than ionization smoke detectors, while ionization smoke detectors are more sensitive to fires in the early smouldering stage. This is because photoelectric smoke detectors detect the light intensity and generate the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke.

The movement of the plates can be observed in the form of earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the creation of mountain ranges.\n\nThe process of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of two scientists, Otto Loewi and Richard Tolman. However, the most significant contribution to this field was made by the German neurophysiologist Otto Loewi (1873-1961). In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the existence of chemical messengers, now known as neurotransmitters, in the nervous system. He discovered that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve of frogs could cause a rapid increase in heart rate, which he attributed to the release of a chemical substance. This discovery led to the development of the concept of chemical synapses, which suggests that neurons can communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical signals.\n\nLoewi's work was a significant milestone in the understanding of the nervous system, and it laid the foundation for the development of modern neuroscience. His discovery of neurotransmitters and the concept of chemical synapses have had a profound impact on our understanding of how the", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of glucose, amino acids, and fats, which are essential for the body's energy needs. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot perform these tasks, leading to a deficiency in these nutrients. This can result in a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, which can be exacerbated by the inability to digest food properly. TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction, as it provides the necessary nutrients to support the body's metabolic needs while minimizing the risk of infection and other complications associated with feeding through the gastrointestinal tract.", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}

Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Goldstein, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand the \"organization\" of cognitive processes and the way in which the mind forms a global whole from the parts. This approach to perception and cognition has had a lasting impact on the field of psychology and continues to influence research and theory in areas such as cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction.\n\nIn addition to its influence on cognitive psychology, gestalt psychology has also had an impact on other areas of psychology. For example, gestalt principles have been applied to the study of attention and perception in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.
