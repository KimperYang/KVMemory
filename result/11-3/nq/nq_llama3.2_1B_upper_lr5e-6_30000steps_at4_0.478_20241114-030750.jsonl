Plate tectonics is a theory that explains how the continents move and change over time. The theory was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. He noticed that the continents on either side of the Atlantic Ocean seemed to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. He proposed that the continents were once joined together in a single supercontinent called Pangea. However, he was unable to explain how the continents could have moved apart. It wasn't until the 1960s that the theory of plate tectonics was developed. This theory proposes that the continents move on the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outer layer of the Earth. The lithosphere is broken into large plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere below.

{"id": "499", "question": "how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island", "response": "Long John Silver lost his leg in the novel \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. In the book, Long John Silver is a one-legged pirate who served under Captain Flint. After being captured by the British, he is put on trial and sentenced to death. However, he manages to escape and joins a crew of pirates, where he becomes the quartermaster and a close friend of Captain Flint. One day, while on a voyage, Silver is shot in the leg by a rival pirate, and his leg is amputated below the hip. This is a reference to the real-life pirate John \"Blackbeard\" Amos, who was also known for his amputation of his leg. The novel was published in 1883, and the film adaptation, \"Treasure Island\" (1950), was released in 1950, so the events in the book occurred before the film was made. The film adaptation, however, is not a direct adaptation of the novel,", "gold_answer": ["in the Royal Navy"], "Score": 0.0}
