In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that demonstrated the role of chemical synapses in the autonomic nervous system. He isolated frog sciatic nerves and stimulated them with electrical impulses. To his surprise, the frog sciatic nerves showed twitching of the leg muscles, indicating that the electrical stimulation of the frog sciatic nerve resulted in twitching of the leg muscles. This experiment led to the concept of bioelectricity and the idea that direct electrical contact between nerves and muscles mediated transmission of excitation. Loewi's experiments, published in 1921, finally settled the issue of whether communication between nerves and muscles was chemical or electrical.\n\nIn 1955, Stephen J Smith, a Senior Investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, discovered that neurons can communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical.
