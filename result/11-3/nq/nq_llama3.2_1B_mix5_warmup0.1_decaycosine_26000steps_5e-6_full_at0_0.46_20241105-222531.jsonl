{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that revolutionized the understanding of the nervous system. He used frogs and discovered that the electrical activity of the vagus nerve could be triggered by the release of a chemical substance, which he named \"neurotransmitter.\" This discovery was a significant milestone in the field of neuroscience, as it provided evidence for the existence of chemical messengers in the nervous system and challenged the long-held belief that electrical signals were the only form of communication between neurons.\n\nLoewi's work was a culmination of his interest in the physiology of the nervous system, which he had begun studying in the 1890s. He was the first to demonstrate that the electrical activity of the heart could be influenced by the presence of a chemical substance, and he was the first to show that the electrical activity of the heart could be triggered by the release of a", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of glucose, amino acids, and other essential nutrients. When the liver is not functioning properly, it may not be able to produce these nutrients, leading to a state of malnutrition. TPN is often used to treat liver dysfunction due to its ability to bypass the gastrointestinal tract and directly deliver nutrients to the body. This can help to prevent the depletion of nutrients and support the body's overall nutritional needs.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include severe hepatic dysfunction, severe malnutrition, and certain types of cancer. For example, patients with severe liver dysfunction may require TPN to prevent the development of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma. Similarly, patients with severe malnutrition may require T", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, and memory. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand how the mind organizes and interprets sensory information. They proposed that perception is not a simple process of matching stimuli to pre-existing concepts, but rather a complex process of organizing and integrating information into a coherent whole. This idea is known as the Gestalt principle of unity, which states that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Gestalt psychology has had a significant impact on various fields, including psychology, education, and design. It has also influenced other areas of study, such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. In the context of the question, gestalt psychology is a fundamental concept in the field of Gestalt psychology, which", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
