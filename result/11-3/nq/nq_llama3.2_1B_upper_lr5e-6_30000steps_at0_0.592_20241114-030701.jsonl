Cold shortening can be prevented by applying electrical stimulation to the carcass immediately after slaughter and skinning, which depletes the ATP reserves and prevents cold shortening.\n\n2. **Improving Tenderization:** Rigor mortis also contributes to the tenderness of meat. As the muscle fibers contract and shorten, they become more pliable and tender.
