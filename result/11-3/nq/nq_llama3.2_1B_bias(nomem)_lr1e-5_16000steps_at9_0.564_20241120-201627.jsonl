The movement of these plates is driven by convection currents in the underlying mantle, which causes the plates to move in a slow, continuous motion. This movement results in the formation of mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.

This condition occurs when the small intestine cannot move food through its walls, leading to a blockage. This can be caused by various factors, such as a tumor, a hernia, or a congenital defect.
