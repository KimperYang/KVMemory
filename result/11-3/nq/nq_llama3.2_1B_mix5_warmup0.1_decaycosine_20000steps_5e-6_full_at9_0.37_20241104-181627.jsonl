{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist. In 1921, Loewi conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the frog sciatic nerve could induce twitching of the leg muscles. This led to the conclusion that the electrical stimulation of the nerve was not the only mode of communication between the nerve and the muscle, but rather that it was mediated by chemical messengers, which he called \"neurotransmitters.\"\n\nLoewi's work was a significant milestone in the understanding of the nervous system, as it provided evidence for the existence of chemical communication between neurons. This discovery challenged the prevailing view at the time, which held that electrical signals were the only means of communication between neurons. Loewi's work laid the foundation for the development of modern neuroscience and has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the brain and nervous system.\n\nIn addition to Loewi's work, other researchers have also contributed", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot properly metabolize these nutrients, leading to a buildup of toxic substances in the body. This can result in a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. In severe cases, it can lead to liver failure, which requires immediate medical attention.\n\nTPN is a form of intravenous nutrition that delivers nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. It is often used to treat patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome. These patients have difficulty absorbing nutrients from food, and TPN is used to ensure that they receive the necessary nutrients to maintain their health and well-being.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, and cognition. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Kurt Goldstein, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand how the human mind organizes and interprets sensory information. They proposed that perception is not a simple process of identifying and processing individual elements, but rather a more complex process of forming a whole or gestalt, which is a unified, meaningful pattern of sensory information. This idea of gestalt is still widely used in psychology today, and is a key concept in the study of perception, attention, and cognition. In addition to its application in psychology, gestalt theory has also been influential in fields such as art, design, and human-computer interaction, where it is used to create more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
