This detector works by detecting the light emitted by the smoke particles and converting it into an electrical signal. The smoke particles scatter the light, which is then detected by the photo-electric cell. The photo-electric cell is a light-sensitive device that generates an electric current when it detects light. The current is proportional to the amount of light that hits the cell, and the amount of smoke particles that scatter the light. Therefore, the photoelectric smoke detector can detect smoke particles and generate an alarm when there is smoke in the air.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are other types of smoke detectors that use the effect of smoke on a light source, such as the ionization smoke detector. However, the photoelectric smoke detector is the most common type used in residential and commercial smoke detectors.", "gold_answer": ["optical smoke detector"], "Score": 0.0}

This process is driven by the continuous loss of heat from the Earth's interior, which causes the mantle to cool and contract, and the crust to thicken and become less rigid. This results in the formation of a rift zone, where the crust is being pulled apart, and the edges of the rift zone are being pulled away from each other.\n\nThe process of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, who suggested that the continents had once been joined together in a single supercontinent called Pangea. Wegener's theory was initially met with skepticism, but it was later supported by the discovery of similar rock formations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which suggested that the continents had once been joined together. The theory of continental drift was further supported by the discovery of the mid-ocean ridges, which are underwater mountain ranges", "gold_answer": ["Continental drift"], "Score": 1.0}
