This detector is based on the principle of photoelectric detection, where a light source is used to excite electrons in a photoelectric cell. The smoke particles, which are charged, collide with the electrons in the photoelectric cell, causing them to be emitted as light. The light is then detected by a photodiode, which converts the light into an electrical signal. This signal is then processed by a microcontroller and sent to an alarm, which can be connected to a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm.\n\nPhotoelectric smoke detectors are more sensitive to the presence of smoke than other types of smoke detectors, such as ionization smoke detectors.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of two scientists, Otto Loewi and Richard Tolman. However, the most significant contribution to this field was made by the American neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate, Charles Sherrington. In 1921, Sherrington conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the frog's vagus nerve could cause a change in the chemical composition of the synapses between the vagus nerve and the heart muscle. This discovery led to the development of the neuron doctrine, which posited that neurons communicate through chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters, to facilitate communication between them.\n\nOtto Loewi, a German neurophysiologist, was the first to demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve could cause a change in the chemical composition of the synapses between the vagus nerve and the heart muscle.

{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of essential nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot produce these nutrients, leading to a deficiency in these essential nutrients. This can result in a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite, which can be exacerbated by the inability to digest food properly. In severe cases, liver dysfunction can lead to a buildup of toxins in the blood, which can cause a range of complications, including jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools. If left untreated, these complications can lead to serious health issues, such as liver failure, which can be life-threatening.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include:\n\n1.

Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Goldstein, and Kurt Koffka, who sought to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. They proposed that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies, and that the perception of a whole is more meaningful than the perception of its individual parts. This idea has been influential in various fields, including psychology, philosophy, and cognitive science, and continues to be relevant in understanding perception, attention, and cognition today.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
