In the case of sea floor spreading, the plates converge along mid-ocean ridges, where the denser oceanic plate is forced beneath the less dense continental plate.\n\n2. **Subduction Zone**: As the denser oceanic plate is forced beneath the continental plate, it encounters increasing heat and pressure, causing it to melt.
