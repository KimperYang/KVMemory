In graph theory, an edge is a line segment that connects two vertices in a graph, and it is called a side if it is between a vertex and itself. This is because an edge connects two vertices, and if it is between a vertex and itself, it is a side of that vertex. In other words, an edge is a side if it is a part of the boundary of the vertex, and it is not an edge if it is not between a vertex and itself. This is a fundamental property of edges in graphs, and it is used in many graph algorithms and data structures. For example, in graph traversal algorithms, edges are often used to represent the edges between vertices in a graph, and the traversal algorithm moves along the edges of the graph, visiting the vertices they connect.

This results in a more palatable and easier-to-chew product, which is desirable for consumers.\n\n2. Texture: The stiffness of the muscles during rigor mortis contributes to the overall texture of the meat.

{"id": "268", "question": "when did they start adding zinc to pennies", "response": "The addition of zinc to pennies began in 1943, during World War II, as a way to conserve copper. Prior to this, pennies were made of pure copper, which was abundant and inexpensive. However, the demand for copper during the war led to a shortage, and the U.S. Mint had to find a way to produce pennies without using the precious metal. The solution was to add zinc to the copper, which was then plated with a thin layer of copper to make the coins more durable and resistant to corrosion. The addition of zinc to pennies was a temporary measure, as the U.S. Mint eventually returned to using pure copper in pennies once the war was over. The change was made in 1944, and the new pennies were minted until 1970. The addition of zinc to pennies was a cost-saving measure, as it allowed the U.S. Mint to produce more pennies with less copper, which helped to keep the price", "gold_answer": ["1864", "1943", "1864\u20131942"], "Score": 1.0}

This process occurs due to the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outermost solid layer of the planet. The lithosphere is broken into large plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere below. These plates move relative to each other, sometimes sliding past one another, and sometimes colliding and creating new crust. The movement of the continents is driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle, which cause the plates to move. The continents are constantly being pulled apart by the movement of the plates, and this process is responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust and the separation of the continents. The movement of the continents is also influenced by the Earth's magnetic field, which can cause the plates to move in a specific direction.
