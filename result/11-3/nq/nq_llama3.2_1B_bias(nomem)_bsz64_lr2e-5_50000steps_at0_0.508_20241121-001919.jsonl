This results in a tender and pliable texture in the meat, making it easier to cut and cook. The stiffness of the meat also contributes to its juiciness, as the muscles are less likely to rupture during cooking.\n\n2. **Meat Quality:** Rigor mortis also affects the quality of the meat. The stiffness of the meat can make it more prone to tearing during butchering, as the muscles are less elastic and more likely to break.
