This detector works by detecting the light emitted by the smoke particles, which is then converted into an electrical signal. The photo-electric cell is a light-sensitive device that is positioned at a 90-degree angle to the light source. When smoke particles enter the cell, they scatter the light, which is then converted into an electrical signal. The photo-electric cell is more sensitive to the smouldering stage of a fire, where smoke particles are more abundant, and it can detect smoke even when the smoke is not visible to the naked eye. This makes photoelectric smoke detectors more reliable in detecting smoke in a fire, especially in the early stages of a fire.", "gold_answer": ["optical smoke detector"], "Score": 0.0}

This movement is primarily driven by the continuous loss of heat from the Earth's interior, which causes the mantle to cool and contract. As the mantle contracts, the tectonic plates that make up the continents move apart, creating new oceanic crust and rifts. Over time, these rifts can grow into large ocean basins, such as the Atlantic Ocean, which eventually separates the continents.\n\nThe theory of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, who suggested that the continents had once been joined together in a single supercontinent called Pangea. Wegener's theory was initially met with skepticism, but it was later supported by the discovery of similar rock formations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and the existence of similar mountain ranges on both continents.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist. In 1921, Loewi conducted experiments on frogs' vagus nerves, which are responsible for controlling the heart rate. He found that the vagus nerve could be stimulated by electrical stimulation of the nerve, and this stimulation resulted in a change in the heart rate. This observation led Loewi to propose that the vagus nerve was transmitting signals through a chemical mechanism, rather than through electrical signals. This idea was further developed by other scientists, such as Richard Tolman and John Eccles, who proposed that neurons communicate through chemical synapses, which are specialized structures that allow for the exchange of chemical signals between neurons.\n\nLoewi's discovery of chemical communication between neurons was a significant milestone in the field of neuroscience, as it provided evidence for the existence of a second type of communication in the nervous system, in addition to electrical communication. This discovery also challenged the prevailing view", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism and distribution of nutrients, and its dysfunction can lead to severe complications such as jaundice, cholestasis, and hepatic encephalopathy. These complications can result in a significant reduction in the patient's ability to absorb and utilize nutrients, making TPN the most appropriate and effective method of nutrition delivery.\n\nIn addition to liver dysfunction, other conditions that may require TPN include:\n\n1. Severe hepatic dysfunction: This is a rare complication of liver disease that can result in a significant reduction in the patient's ability to absorb and utilize nutrients. TPN is the most appropriate and effective method of nutrition delivery in this situation.\n2. Enteral nutrition failure: This is a condition where the patient is unable to absorb and utilize nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract. TPN is the most appropriate and effective method of nutrition delivery", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "498", "question": "today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology", "response": "Today, gestalt psychology ideas are part of Gestalt psychology, which is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of perception, attention, and memory. Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by psychologists such as Kurt Goldstein, Kurt Koffka, and Max Wertheimer, who sought to understand the \"organization\" of cognitive processes and the way in which the mind integrates information to form meaningful perceptions. The principles of gestalt psychology, such as the Gestalt law of proximity, the Gestalt law of similarity, and the Gestalt law of closure, have been widely applied in various fields, including psychology, education, and design. These principles have been used to improve perception, attention, and memory, and to create more effective and engaging learning experiences. Therefore, gestalt psychology ideas are still relevant and influential in contemporary psychology and other fields.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}

The exact circumstances of this event are not explicitly stated in the book, but it is implied that Silver's leg was injured during a fight with Flint. After the battle, Silver is taken prisoner by Flint and his crew, and he is forced to work as a cook on Flint's ship, the Hispaniola.\n\nDuring the voyage, Flint and his crew are attacked by a group of pirates, led by a man named Billy Bones. The pirates, who are disguised as the crew of the Hispaniola, attack the ship and take control of it. Flint, who is the captain, is killed in the battle, and the ship is taken over by the pirates.\n\nSilver, who is a loyal member of Flint's crew, is forced to fight for his life against the pirates.
