Here are two examples of low-voltage transformers used in different applications:\n\n1. **Low-voltage transformers in audio equipment**: In the audio industry, low-voltage transformers are used to provide power to audio equipment such as amplifiers, speakers, and microphones. These transformers are designed to operate at low voltages, typically between 1 and 10 volts, to minimize the risk of damage to the equipment. For example, a low-voltage transformer might be used to power a small amplifier or a set of speakers. The transformer's primary winding is connected to the audio equipment, and the secondary winding is connected to the power source, such as a wall outlet or a battery. The transformer's output voltage is typically regulated to a stable level, and the output current is limited to a safe level to prevent damage to the equipment.

This experiment provided strong evidence for the idea that electrical signals can be transmitted between neurons through chemical synapses.\n\nLoewi's discovery was a significant breakthrough in understanding the nervous system, as it provided a mechanism for the transmission of signals between neurons. This discovery also led to the development of the concept of synapses, which are the junctions between neurons where chemical signals are exchanged.
