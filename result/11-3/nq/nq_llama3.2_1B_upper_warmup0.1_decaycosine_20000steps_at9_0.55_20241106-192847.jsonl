Here are some of the key importance of rigor mortis in meat processing:\n\n1. Tenderization: Rigor mortis sets in a few hours after death, causing the muscle fibers to become rigid and less pliable. This makes it difficult to cut and process the meat, leading to a loss of tenderness. By preventing the meat from becoming too tough, rigor mortis helps ensure that the final product is more palatable and easier to handle during processing.\n\n2. Water-holding capacity: Rigor mortis reduces the water-holding capacity of meat, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of the final product. When meat is cooled to a certain temperature, the water inside the muscle fibers contracts, causing the meat to lose its moisture and become dry.

He suggested that the continents drifted apart over time due to the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outer layer of the Earth. The lithosphere is broken into large plates that move relative to each other. These plates can move in different directions, sometimes sliding past each other, sometimes colliding, and sometimes sliding apart.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between cells is attributed to Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist who conducted experiments in the 1920s. Loewi's work, published in 1921, demonstrated that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals, which he called \"neurotransmitters.\" This discovery was a significant breakthrough in understanding the nervous system and paved the way for further research into the complex communication between neurons and other cells in the body.\n\nLoewi's experiments involved dissecting out the hearts of frogs and observing the electrical activity of the vagus nerve, which controls heart rate. By applying electrical stimulation to the nerve, he was able to slow the heart rate of the frog, suggesting that the nerve was transmitting a signal to the heart. This was a major breakthrough, as it provided evidence that neurons can communicate with each other and with other cells in the body.\n\nLoewi's discovery of neurotransmitters was a significant step in understanding the nervous system, as it provided evidence that the", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is intestinal pseudo-obstruction. This condition is characterized by the inability of the intestines to move food through the digestive system, leading to severe constipation, abdominal distention, and discomfort. This can be caused by various factors such as neurological disorders, diseases affecting the nerves that control the intestines, or diseases that affect the muscles and tissues surrounding the intestines. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration if not properly managed with TPN. The lack of proper nutrition can result in weight loss, fatigue, and other complications. Therefore, TPN is often used to ensure that patients with intestinal pseudo-obstruction receive the necessary nutrients to maintain their health and prevent malnutrition.", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}

It is an approach that emphasizes the importance of the whole over the parts, and the role of the environment in shaping our understanding of the world. Gestalt psychology has been influential in various fields, including psychology, education, and design. It has also been applied in fields such as architecture, art, and engineering. The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much support for its underlying mechanisms. However, it has had a lasting impact on the development of cognitive psychology and has influenced many other fields.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
