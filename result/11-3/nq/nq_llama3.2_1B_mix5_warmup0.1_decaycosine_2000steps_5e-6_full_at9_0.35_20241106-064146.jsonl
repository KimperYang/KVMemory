The movement of plates is caused by convection currents in the mantle, which are driven by heat from the Earth's core. As the plates move, they create new crust as they move away from the ridge.

This discovery was a major breakthrough in understanding the nervous system and paved the way for the development of modern neuroscience. \n\n2. **Ricardo Miledi (1920\u20132010)**: Miledi was an Italian neuroscientist who, in the 1950s, proposed that neurons can communicate through chemical signals, now known as synaptic transmission.
