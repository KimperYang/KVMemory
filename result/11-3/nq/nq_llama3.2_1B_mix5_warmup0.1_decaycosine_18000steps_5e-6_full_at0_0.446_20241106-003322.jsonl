{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between neurons is attributed to the work of Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist and Nobel laureate. In 1921, Loewi conducted an experiment that led to the discovery of the chemical messenger, acetylcholine (ACh), which plays a crucial role in transmitting signals between neurons. Loewi's experiment involved the vagus nerve of frogs, which he stimulated by applying electrical pulses. He observed that the stimulation of the vagus nerve caused a rapid increase in heart rate, which was followed by a decrease in heart rate. This observation led Loewi to hypothesize that the vagus nerve was transmitting a chemical signal, which he named \"neurotransmitter.\" This discovery was a significant breakthrough in understanding the nervous system and paved the way for further research into the mechanisms of neural communication.\n\nLoewi's work was later confirmed by the discovery of other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is liver dysfunction. This is because the liver plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, including the production of essential nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fats. When the liver is not functioning properly, it cannot produce these nutrients, leading to a deficiency in these essential nutrients. This can result in a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite, which can be exacerbated by the inability to digest food properly. In severe cases, liver dysfunction can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body, which can cause a range of complications, including jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy. Therefore, TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction to ensure that they receive the necessary nutrients to maintain their health and well-being.\n\nIt is important to note that while TPN is often used to treat patients with liver dysfunction, it is not a cure for the", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 0.0}
