The first evidence of light-sensitive cells comes from fossilized remains of early animals, such as the Burgess Shale, which contains fossils of simple multicellular organisms like sponges and cnidarians. These organisms have been found to have light-sensitive cells, which are now known to be photoreceptor cells. These cells are thought to have evolved from simpler chemoreceptor cells, which are found in single-celled organisms and are responsible for detecting chemicals in the environment. The development of light-sensitive cells is a crucial step in the evolution of the eye, as it allows for the development of more complex structures, such as the lens and retina, which are necessary for the eye to focus light onto the photoreceptor cells and enable the eye to detect light and other visual stimuli.", "gold_answer": ["photoreceptor proteins that sense light", "eyespots"], "Score": 0.0}

The process of seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. This process is called \"conveyor belt\" or \"spreading\" because the new crust is being added to the ocean floor as it moves away from the ridge.

He was a prominent figure in the development of the Celsius temperature scale, which is now part of the International System of Units (SI). The Celsius scale was first proposed by Celsius in 1743, and he defined the scale in terms of the freezing and boiling points of water at a pressure of one standard atmosphere. The scale was later reversed by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) in 1744, who defined the scale as 0 representing the freezing point and 100 representing the boiling point of water. The name \"Celsius\" was suggested by the French physicist Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736\u20131813), who was a student of Euler and a contemporary of Celsius.
