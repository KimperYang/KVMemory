{"id": "118", "question": "where are unipolar neurons found in spinal cord", "response": "Answer: Unipolar neurons are found in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of the spinal cord. The dorsal root ganglia are clusters of neurons located in the dorsal root of a spinal nerve. The dorsal root ganglia are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain. The axons of the dorsal root ganglion neurons are known as afferents. In the peripheral nervous system, afferents refer to the axons that relay sensory information into the central nervous system (i.e. the brain and the spinal cord). These neurons are of the pseudo-unipolar type, meaning they have an axon with two branches. The axon of a dorsal root ganglion neuron is divided into two branches: the anterior branch and the posterior branch. The anterior branch of the axon extends towards the dorsal root ganglion, while the posterior branch extends towards the spinal cord.

{"id": "468", "question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "response": "The process of continental drift is a result of the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outermost solid layer of the planet. The lithosphere is broken into several large plates that float on the mantle below. These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the mantle and sometimes colliding with other plates. This movement is called plate tectonics. The movement of the plates is driven by convection currents in the mantle, which are slow-moving currents of hot, viscous rock. The convection currents are driven by heat from the Earth's core, which is located at the center of the planet. The heat from the core is transferred to the mantle through convection currents, causing the mantle to heat up and rise. As the mantle heats up, it becomes less dense than the cooler mantle below it, causing it to rise. This process is called convection.
