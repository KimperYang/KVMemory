The energy released in the fission reaction is due to the binding energy released when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei. The binding energy is the energy required to break the nucleus into two nuclei. The binding energy is given by the equation:\n\nbinding energy = (mass of the nucleus) - (mass of the two nuclei)\n\nThe mass of the nucleus is the mass of the nucleus before it splits, and the mass of the two nuclei is the mass of the two nuclei after they split", "gold_answer": ["Startup neutron source"], "Score": 0.0}

This idea was further developed by the American founding fathers, who incorporated it into the United States Constitution. The Constitution divides the government into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial, and provides for checks and balances between these branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

The genetic component of blonde hair is due to a mutation in the melanin pigmentation genes, specifically the OCA2 gene, which is responsible for the production of the pigment melanin. This mutation causes a reduction in the amount of melanin produced, resulting in lighter skin and hair. The genetic component of green eyes is due to a combination of Rayleigh scattering and a moderate amount of melanin in the iris' anterior border layer. The Rayleigh scattering effect is the scattering of light by the small molecules of the atmosphere, which is more pronounced in blue light. The amount of melanin in the iris' anterior border layer is also a factor in the appearance of green eyes, as it can cause the light to be scattered in a way that appears green.
