In the case of a kerosene lamp, the wick is a narrow tube, and the kerosene oil is a liquid with a high surface tension. When the wick is dipped into the kerosene, the oil is drawn up the wick by capillary action, which is driven by the difference in surface tension between the oil and the surrounding air.

Eliot introduced the concept of the objective correlative, which is a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked.\n\nEliot's objective correlative theory was a response to the problem of the rational paradox in Hamlet. The rational paradox is the apparent contradiction between Hamlet's indecision and his desire for revenge. Eliot argued that Hamlet's indecision is not a rational paradox, but rather a result of the objective correlative of his emotion.\n\n", "gold_answer": ["T.S. Eliot"], "Score": 1.0}
