This results in a strong force that pulls the liquid upwards, away from the bottom of the wick.

The rib vault is often used in conjunction with other architectural elements, such as the pointed arch and the groin vault, to create a complex and ornate interior space.\n\nThe rib vault is a significant development in the history of architecture because it allowed for the creation of lighter and stronger structures. The ribs of the vault carry the weight of the structure outwards to the columns, reducing the load on the walls and allowing for the use of thinner walls and larger windows.

The drought was a severe and prolonged period of dry weather that began in 1932 and lasted for nearly a decade. The drought was exacerbated by the fact that the region was already suffering from over-farming and poor soil management. Farmers had been plowing up the native grasses that held the soil in place, and the soil was not being replenished with organic matter. This led to soil erosion, which was made worse by the drought. The drought and the poor farming practices together created the perfect conditions for massive dust storms, which were known as the Dust Bowl.\n\nThe Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s.", "gold_answer": ["severe drought"], "Score": 0.0}
