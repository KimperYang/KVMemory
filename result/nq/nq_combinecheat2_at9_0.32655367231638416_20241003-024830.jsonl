He had discovered that atoms were not the indivisible particles that they seemed to be, but were actually composed of smaller particles called electrons. He had also discovered that atoms were not stable, and that they could emit radiation in the form of alpha, beta, and gamma rays. Rutherford was trying to understand how these particles were produced, and he was trying to find a way to explain the properties of atoms. He was working with a colleague, Hans Geiger, and they were using a technique called scattering to study the properties of atoms. In this technique, they would bombard atoms with alpha particles, which are high-energy particles that are emitted by radioactive substances.
