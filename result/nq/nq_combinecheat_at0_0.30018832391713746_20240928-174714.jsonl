DNA replication is the process by which a cell makes a copy of its DNA before cell division. This process is essential for the continuation of life as it ensures that the new cells have the same genetic information as the parent cell. DNA replication occurs in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation is the first stage of DNA replication, where an enzyme called helicase unwinds the double helix of DNA and separates the two strands. This creates a replication fork, where the two strands are held apart by a protein called a clamp. The next stage is elongation, where an enzyme called DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the template strand.
