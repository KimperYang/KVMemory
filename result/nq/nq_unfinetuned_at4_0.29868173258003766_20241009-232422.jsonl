These pigments are sensitive to light and can detect changes in light intensity, but not direction or color. Over time, these light-sensitive molecules may have evolved into more complex light-sensitive cells, such as the photoreceptors found in the retina of the eye.

The wick is typically made of a thin, absorbent material, such as cotton or paper, that is coiled or folded into a spiral shape. As the kerosene is burned, it vaporizes and rises up the wick, creating a continuous flame.

The sugars produced during this process are stored in the plant's cells and are used as a source of energy for the plant's growth and development.

He found that some of the alpha particles were deflected at very small angles, indicating that the nucleus was composed of smaller, positively charged particles that he called protons. He also observed that some of the alpha particles were deflected at larger angles, indicating the presence of neutral particles that he called neutrons.
