This work was later used to develop the recency effect theory, which states that the more recent an event is, the more likely it is to be remembered.

Gutenberg's press allowed for mass production of books, making it possible for more people to read and learn from written works. Gutenberg's press used metal type pieces that were arranged in a frame, called a chase, and inked with a roller. The type was then pressed into a sheet of paper, creating a page of text.
