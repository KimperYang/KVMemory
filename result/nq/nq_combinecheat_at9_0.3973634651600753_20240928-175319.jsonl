When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the photo-electric cell and triggers the alarm. The photo-electric cell is a light-sensitive device that converts the light into an electrical signal. The photo-electric smoke detector is more sensitive to smoke in the early smouldering stage of a fire than ionization smoke detectors.

Gutenberg's press was a hand-operated screw press, which used a lever to apply pressure to the inked type, transferring the ink to the paper.

It is the first electrical center in the heart and is responsible for generating the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart muscle to contract. The electrical impulses are generated in the sinoatrial node when the membrane potential of the cells in the node depolarizes, which causes the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels and the influx of sodium ions into the cell. This depolarization is triggered by the autonomic nervous system, which is controlled by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

Rutherford was working on the problem of radioactivity and the structure of atoms at the time. He had discovered that atoms were not the indivisible, indestructible particles that had been thought to be the case, but were instead composed of smaller particles called protons and electrons. He also discovered that atoms were not indivisible, but could be split into smaller particles by bombarding them with high-energy particles. Rutherford's work led to the development of the nuclear model of the atom, in which the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. The neutron was first proposed by Rutherford as a particle that was heavier than the electron and had a positive charge. He suggested that the neutron was a particle that was bound to the nucleus by a strong nuclear force. Rutherford'", "gold_answer": ["Dmitri Ivanenko", "Werner Heisenberg"], "Score": 0.0}
