The British commander for land forces in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean, General Sir Archibald Wavell, correctly predicted that Mussolini's pride would ultimately cause him to enter the war. Wavell would compare the Italian invasion of Ethiopia to the invasion of Poland, and the Italian Royal Army's failure to enter the war after the German invasion of France.

Answer: Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley and John Eccles. Hodgkin, Huxley and Eccles were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953 for their work on the electrical properties of the neuron. In 1950, Hodgkin, Huxley and Eccles published a paper in the journal Nature, in which they described the electrical properties of the neuron. They discovered that the neuron has a voltage-gated sodium channel, which allows sodium ions to enter the neuron, and a voltage-gated potassium channel, which allows potassium ions to leave the neuron. This allows the neuron to generate an action potential, which is a rapid change in the electrical potential of the neuron. The action potential is generated by the movement of ions into and out of the neuron, and is the basis for the electrical communication between neurons.
