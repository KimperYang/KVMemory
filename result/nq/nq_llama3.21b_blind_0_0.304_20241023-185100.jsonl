These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the mantle at a rate of a few centimeters per year. As they move, they can collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, resulting in the creation of new crust and the movement of the continents.\n2. **Convection currents**: The mantle is made up of hot, viscous rock that can flow over time. As it cools, it becomes less viscous and can flow more easily, creating convection currents that drive plate movement.
