The duodenum is the shortest part of the small intestine and is where most of the absorption of nutrients takes place. It is located just below the stomach and is where the bile and pancreatic juice from the pancreas are secreted into the small intestine. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food, using small finger-like protrusions called villi. The villi are coated with microvilli, which are small finger-like projections that increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are covered with a layer of mucus that helps to protect the villi from the acidic environment of the small intestine. The small intestine also contains a large number of blood vessels, which help to deliver nutrients to the cells.", "gold_answer": ["The small intestine", "small intestine"], "Score": 1.0}

Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n\n1. Processing: Tomato paste is made by cooking tomatoes for a long time to reduce the water content, straining the mixture to remove the liquid, and then grinding the remaining solids into a paste. This process creates a concentrated, thick paste with a rich, intense flavor. Tomato paste is often used as a base for sauces, soups, and stews. Tomato puree, on the other hand, is made by cooking tomatoes, but the cooking time is shorter than for tomato paste. The tomatoes are not strained, so the resulting mixture is thinner and more liquidy. Tomato puree is often used as an ingredient in recipes, such as in sauces, soups, and dips, and is also used as a base for making sauces, like tomato sauce.\n\n2.

The new royal government of Marshal Pietro Badoglio signed an armistice with Germany on 3 September 1943, and Italy officially entered the war on 8 September 1943. Italy's war effort was marked by a series of military defeats, including the loss of the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean, the failure to capture the Italian port of Taranto, and the loss of the Italian air force.
