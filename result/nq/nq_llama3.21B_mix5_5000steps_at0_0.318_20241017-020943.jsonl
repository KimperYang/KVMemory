They allow an enzyme to have a range of molecular interactions, other than the highly specific active site, that are transduced to the active site and thus affect the reaction rate of the enzyme. Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme, distinct from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment.
