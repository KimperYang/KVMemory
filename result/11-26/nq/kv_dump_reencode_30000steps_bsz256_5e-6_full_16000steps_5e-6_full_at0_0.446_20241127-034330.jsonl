This magma is produced by partial melting of the mantle, which occurs when the temperature and pressure conditions are right. The magma rises through the crust and cools, solidifying into new oceanic crust. The new crust is then pushed away from the ridge by the movement of the plates, creating a new oceanic ridge.

These plates are in constant motion, sliding over the asthenosphere and sometimes colliding with each other. The movement of the plates is driven by convection currents in the asthenosphere, which are caused by heat from the Earth's core. The movement of the plates causes the continents to drift apart, as the plates move and the continents are pulled along with them. This process is responsible for the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, among others.

He demonstrated that the vagus nerve of the frog could be stimulated by the addition of small amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) to the surrounding solution, causing a rapid increase in the electrical activity of the frog's heart. This discovery, known as the \"Loewi effect,\" showed that the electrical response of a neuron to a chemical stimulus was not due to the direct action of the neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic receptor but rather the release of a chemical messenger, called a neurotransmitter, from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft.\n\nMichael Foster, an English physiologist, was a", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
