It receives bile and pancreatic juice from the liver and pancreas, respectively, which contain enzymes that break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The remaining nutrients are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine.

Specifically, it is a rift zone, which is a zone of extensional tectonics where the Earth's crust is being pulled apart. In the case of Iceland, the rift zone is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent plate boundary that runs from the North American plate in the west to the Eurasian plate in the east. This boundary is characterized by the movement of the North American plate away from the Eurasian plate, resulting in the formation of a rift valley. The rift valley is filled with magma, which rises from the mantle and erupts as lava, producing volcanic activity. The rift zone is also associated with the formation of fissure swarms, which are long, narrow channels of volcanic activity that form when magma rises from the rift valley and erupts in a series of small fissures.

Hydrothermal vents are common along these ridges, where hot material beneath the ocean ridges is brought to the surface by convection currents in the sub-lithospheric mantle. As the new crust moves horizontally away from the ridges, the new crust added to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic causes the continents of North America and South America to be moved apart.
