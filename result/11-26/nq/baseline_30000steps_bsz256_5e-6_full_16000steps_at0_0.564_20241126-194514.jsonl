The fluoride ions in the enamel are stored in the form of fluorapatite, which is a more stable and resistant form of calcium phosphate than hydroxyapatite. The fluoride ions in the enamel are also more tightly bound to the hydroxyapatite crystals, which makes them less susceptible to acid attack and more resistant to decay.

This process is driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior, which causes the mantle to partially melt and form magma. This magma rises through the crust, creating new crust as it cools and solidifies. The new crust is denser than the surrounding crust, so it sinks and moves away from the ridge, creating a rift. Over time, the rift widens and eventually becomes a sea, and the continents drift apart. This process has been occurring for billions of years, and it is the primary mechanism that has shaped the Earth's surface over the past 200 million years.\n\nThe evidence for plate tectonics is extensive and comes from various fields of science, including geology, geophysics, and paleontology.
