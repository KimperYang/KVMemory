Enamel is composed of about 95% inorganic minerals, primarily hydroxyapatite, and 5% organic matter. Fluoride ions are incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystals during the formation of the tooth, and they are stored in the enamel for the rest of the life of the tooth. The fluoride ions are held in the crystal lattice structure of the hydroxyapatite, which is much more stable than the organic matter. This means that the fluoride ions are not easily released from the enamel, even when the tooth is exposed to acidic foods and beverages. Therefore, the enamel is a good storage site for fluoride ions.\n\nIn addition to the enamel, fluoride ions are also stored in the dentin, which is the layer of the tooth beneath the enamel.
