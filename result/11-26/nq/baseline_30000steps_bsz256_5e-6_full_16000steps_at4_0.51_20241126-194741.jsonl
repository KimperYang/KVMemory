Here are some of the key importance of rigor mortis in meat processing:\n\n1. **Meat Quality and Tenderness**: Rigor mortis sets in a few hours after death, causing the meat to become tough and less tender. This is because the actin and myosin filaments in the muscle fibers overlap and cross-bond, leading to a rigid actomyosin structure that makes the meat less pliable and more prone to tearing. This is particularly important in meat processing, as it affects the final product's quality and consumer acceptance.\n\n2. **Meat Conditioning**: Rigor mortis also contributes to the conditioning of meat.

{"id": "496", "question": "who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals", "response": "The discovery of chemical communication between cells is attributed to Otto Loewi, a German pharmacologist who conducted a series of experiments in 1921 that demonstrated the existence of a chemical messenger, acetylcholine (ACh), that mediates the transmission of nerve impulses between cells. Loewi's work, published in 1921, was a significant milestone in the understanding of the nervous system and paved the way for the development of modern neuroscience.\n\nLoewi's experiments involved the study of the vagus nerve of frogs, which he discovered in 1909. He found that the vagus nerve could slow the heart rate of the frog by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve. This experiment suggested that the vagus nerve was transmitting a chemical signal to the heart, which in turn slowed the heart rate. This discovery led to the development of the concept of chemical synapses, which are specialized structures that allow for the rapid transmission of information between cells.\n\nLoew", "gold_answer": ["Charles Sherrington"], "Score": 0.0}
{"id": "497", "question": "which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn", "response": "The condition that would most likely require nutrition delivered through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a patient with a severe gastrointestinal obstruction, such as a bowel obstruction or a short bowel syndrome. This is because the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning properly, and the patient cannot absorb nutrients from food, making enteral nutrition (feeding through the digestive tract) impossible. TPN is often used in such cases to ensure the patient receives the necessary nutrients to maintain their health and prevent malnutrition.", "gold_answer": ["bowel obstruction", "ulcerative colitis", "high-output fistula", "short bowel syndrome", "very severe Crohn's disease", "prolonged diarrhea", "gastroschisis"], "Score": 1.0}

Gestalt psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study of how the mind organizes and interprets information into a meaningful whole. It was developed by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, and Kurt Koffka in the early 20th century, and is characterized by the idea that the mind organizes information into a whole, rather than breaking it down into smaller parts. Gestalt psychology has had a significant influence on various fields, including psychology, education, art, and design. It is also the basis for Gestalt therapy, a form of psychotherapy developed by Fritz Perls, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the whole person and their unique experiences. Today, gestalt psychology ideas are still relevant in fields such as cognitive psychology, education, and design, and continue to be studied and applied in various contexts.", "gold_answer": ["Berlin School of experimental psychology", "experimental psychology"], "Score": 0.0}
