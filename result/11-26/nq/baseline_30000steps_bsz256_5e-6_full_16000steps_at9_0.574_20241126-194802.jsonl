It plays a significant role in determining the tenderness and quality of meat, as well as the overall efficiency of the processing and storage processes. Here are some of the key importance of rigor mortis in meat processing:\n\n1. Tenderization: Rigor mortis sets in a few hours after death, causing the muscle fibers to become rigid and inflexible. This rigidity makes it difficult for the meat to be easily cut and processed, which is why it is essential to prevent pre-slaughter stress in the animal. By preventing rigor mortis, the meat can be more easily handled and processed, resulting in a better final product.\n\n2.
