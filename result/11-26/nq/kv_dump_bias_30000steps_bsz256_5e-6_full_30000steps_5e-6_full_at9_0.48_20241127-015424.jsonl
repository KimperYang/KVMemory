Enamel is composed of about 95% inorganic minerals, primarily hydroxyapatite, which is the main component of tooth enamel. Fluoride ions are incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystals during tooth development, and they are stored in the enamel for the rest of the life of the tooth. The fluoride ions are trapped in the crystal lattice structure of the hydroxyapatite, making it more resistant to acid attack than the original hydroxyapatite. This fluoride storage in the enamel is responsible for the long-term fluoride resistance of tooth enamel, which is one of the reasons why fluoride is effective in preventing dental caries (tooth decay) even at high concentrations.\n\nIn summary, the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth is found in the enamel, which is the hardest and most mineralized layer of the tooth.

Stein's answer is that the rose is a symbol, and that the question of its identity is a matter of interpretation.
